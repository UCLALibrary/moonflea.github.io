TRAVEL TO KANSAS CITY:
<p>
AIR:<br>
Several airlines serve Kansas City International (KCI) Airport.  There is no official airline for this meeting.
<p>
	Ground transportation from the airport to the hotel:  There are a variety of ground transportation options from KCI, including shuttle service, taxis, rental cars, and limousine services.  The Westin Crown Center does operate a shuttle bus from KCI to the hotel.  If you choose to use one of the other options, we recommend that you make a reservation before arriving in Kansas City to make sure your pick-up will go smoothly.  Taxis can be called from within the airport but due to city ordinance (not to mention the new security measures) are not allowed to wait curbside.  Approximate taxi fares from KCI to the hotel are $35-40.  More airport and transportation information can be accessed at:  http://www.kcairports.com/kci or at http://www.visitkc.com   If you drive from the airport to the hotel, the distance is approximately 21 miles and travel time (non-rush hour) would be approximately 30 minutes.
<p>
RAIL:<br>
	Kansas City's Amtrak station is served by the Midwest Corridor and Southwest Chief trains, for those who choose not to fly.  The station is conveniently located at 2200 Main St., next to the historic Union Station-just one block from the conference hotel.  For more information about rail schedules, call 1-800-USA-RAIL (1-800-872-7245) or visit http://www.amtrak.com 
<p>
AUTOMOBILE:<br>
	Kansas City is at the terminus of Interstates 29, 35, and 70, and US highways 50 and 71, with easy access into the city from those routes and their feeder highways.  After entering Kansas City, directions are as follows:
