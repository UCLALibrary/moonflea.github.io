<p class="tablecontent">The ALHHS meets annually in conjunction with the American Association for the History of Medicine. The meetings usually consist of half-day programs on topics of interest to archivists, librarians and booksellers. Relevant local tours of historical interest are offered as part of the program. A business meeting is also conducted.  A dinner is traditionally held the night before the meeting.</p>

<p class="tablecontent">The Meeting is usually hosted by an ALHHS member and an associated institution.  Joint meetings with other societies such as the Medical Museums Association have also been held.</p>
