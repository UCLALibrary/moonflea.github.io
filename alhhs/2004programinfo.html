                <td> The 77th Anniversary Conference of the American
                  Association for the History of Medicine, along with
                  the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the
                  Health Sciences, will meet in Madison, Wisconsin,
                  from Wednesday, April 28th through Sunday, May 2nd,
                  2004. On Wednesday the 28th, following the ALHHS
                  Steering Committee meeting, our members will be invited
                  to a personalized dinner at a spiffy local restaurant
                  called Marigold Kitchen. The conference hotel will
                  be the Hilton Monona Terrace, 9 East Wilson St. Madison.
                  (608) 255-5100. The Best Western Inn on the Park,
                  22 South Carroll St., Madison (608) 257-8811, will
                  also be available. Thursday, April 29th, our meeting
                  program, in conjunction with the Medical Museums
                  Association, (MeMA) will include, but not be limited
                  to- a lively panel discussion on establishing regional
                  medical history groups, an update on HIPPA, and a
                  section on collecting and handling archival materials.
                  We will also have our annual business meeting, lunch,
                  and formal or informal afternoon activities, those
                  still being arranged.
                  <P> Arguably, our medical schools (UW-Madison and
                    UW-Milwaukee) and our health sciences collection
                    do not exhibit quite the heritage or “Wow” factor
                    enjoyed by our colleagues in Boston or Bethesda.
                    (Our Pharmacy Collections being the exception,
                    read on…) The three major hospitals in our area
                    do not have significant historical collections.
                    To add insult to injury, the three libraries that
                    encompass our health sciences triumvirate (basic
                    medical sciences, clinical sciences, and pharmacy)
                    are merging and moving, along with the Medical
                    School, into the Health Sciences Learning Center
                    in June of 2004. The new building, with its environmentally
                    controlled vault and customized exhibit areas,
                    will not be accessible the week of our annual meeting.
                    We are arranging a tour for ALHHS members following
                    our Thursday program.
                  <P> In order to make amends for our inability to
                    entertain you with our collections, we are, in
                    conjunction with UW’s Memorial Library and their
                    curator, Robin Rider, having a multi-disciplinary
                    collection exhibit called: “Layers of Knowledge”-
                    which will highlight illustrated texts in anatomy,
                    natural history, astronomy, radiology, geology,
                    printing and art to illustrate the various ways
                    that layers (as a covering, or as in revealing)
                    in illustrations has been used to impart knowledge
                    to the viewer. There will be a reception Thursday
                    evening, April 29th, in the Memorial Library for
                    ALHHS and AAHM attendees.
                  <P> Madison is known for the weekly Farmer’s Market
                    that goes around the state Capitol Square, the
                    University of Wisconsin (Big 10!), the Wisconsin
                    State Historical Society, its lakes, Mendota and
                    Monona, and a wealth of other cultural, natural,
                    social and culinary highlights. Outlying environs
                    include Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin in Spring
                    Green, the Horicon Marsh with its migratory birds,
                    great canoeing, hiking, and bicycling within minutes
                    of this city of 200,000+ and Milwaukee, and its
                    zoo, art museum, sports teams, and restaurants.
                  <P> Other places of interest may be State Street
                    with its bohemian (as well as “chain”) stores,
                    eclectic restaurants, people watching, the Elvehjem
                    museum with its Nineteenth-Century European Prints
                    exhibit slated for this spring, and the free Henry
                    Vilas Zoo. The UW- Union, smack dab on Lake Mendota
                    has the perennial favorite, the Rathskeller, a “tavern” with
                    a lake view great for conversation and people watching.
