This year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences, and to recognize this milestone an anniversary program has been planned for the evening.  Join us for a multi-media presentation, games and brain teasers, and an opportunity to reminisce about ALHHS meetings' past.  Fun will be had by one and all, both new members and those who can actually remember the first meetings!  
The <a href="http://www.cwru.edu/affil/MeMA/memahome.htm">Medical Museums Association</a> (MeMA) has been invited to join us for the evening.  On Thursday buses will depart the Sheraton at 8:00 a.m. for 
UAB’s <a href="http://www.uab.edu/lister/">Lister Hill Library of the Health Sciences</a>, where the ALHHS meeting will be held.
