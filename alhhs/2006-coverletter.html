Dear Colleagues:
<p>

	Who’s excited to go to Halifax! It’s time to schmooze, learn, dine, sightsee, relax, network, and catch up with friends and colleagues.  The 31st annual meeting of the Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences (ALHHS) is being held in Halifax Nova Scotia- from Wednesday, May 3rd through Thursday, May 4th, in conjunction with the American Association for the History of Medicine (AAHM), which runs through Sunday, May 7th. 
<p>
Our Wednesday evening begins with a fabulous culinary opportunity at the Five Fishermen’s private new Chef’s Room www.fivefishermen.com. Plan to be spoiled by the lovely urbane setting, tasty hors d’oeuvres, seafood or chicken entrée (there is a vegetarian choice as well) and undivided attention. The Medical Museums Association (MeMA) and the Coalition of Canadian Healthcare Museums and Archives (CCHMA) will be invited to accompany us at dinner and will be joining us for part of our Thursday meeting program as well.  
<p>
	Our program on Thursday promises to incite discussion, revelations, aha moments, debate and programmatic ideas to take back home. Our multiple panelists will discuss new buildings, lack of space, innovative use of space, new technology, digitization and preservation initiatives, collection management, marketing ideas; anything and everything that can help us all increase our relevancy to our parent institutions.
<p>

I’d like to thank Elaine Challacombe for initiating the Local Arrangements with AAHM’s Peter Twohig, before handing it off to me when she had to undergo a second foot surgery and a long rehabilitation in quite a short time. Thanks also to our Officers and members who have helped in this Not So Terribly Local Arranging. Can’t wait to see you all.
