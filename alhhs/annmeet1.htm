<P>Dear ALHHS Colleague:</P>

<P>The 2000 meeting of Archivists and Librarians in the History of the Health Sciences is 
being held in Bethesda, Maryland, and is hosted by the National Library of Medicine's History 
of Medicine Division.  We have arranged what we think will be a stimulating program and 
exciting tours, coupled with the good food and great camaraderie that we have all grown to 
expect at these meetings.  The conference hotel is the Hyatt Regency Bethesda, while the 
program session and business meeting will be held here at NLM.</P>

<P>The meeting begins with the traditional ALHHS Wednesday night banquet.  This year we will 
meet at the Bethesda Navy Club, located on the grounds of the National Naval Medical Center, 
across the street from NLM.  A bus will be available to transport you from the Hyatt, or you 
may walk or drive.  There will be a cocktail reception (cash bar) from 6:30 to 7:30 PM, 
followed by dinner.  You will have a choice of three entrees (beef, chicken, or vegetarian) plus 
an appetizer and dessert.  Please make your selection on the enclosed registration form, and 
indicate if you will need bus transportation.  Cost for the dinner is $30.
</P>

<P>The Thursday program will begin in the lobby of the Lister Hill Building of the National 
Library of Medicine, where a continental breakfast will be served at 8:30 am.  The business 
meeting will be held in the Lister Hill Auditorium beginning at 9:00 am, and will be followed 
be a program organized by Tom Horrocks of the Countway Library.  The program is entitled 
"Alone Together: Managing History of Medicine Collections in Nonhistorical Environments." 
Details can be found on the <A HREF="annmeet2.htm">meeting schedule</A>.</P>

<P>At noon, we break for lunch.  There will be no formal luncheon.  Instead, you will have the 
option of a cafeteria-style lunch at the Thomas Natcher Conference Center (adjacent to NLM), 
or trying one of Bethesda's many fine restaurants within walking distance of NLM.
</P>
<P>After lunch, we will assemble at 1:00 PM for afternoon tours.  There is a choice of three tours: 
a "Treasures of HMD" tour at NLM; a behind-the-scenes tour of the History of Medicine 
Collection at National Museum of American History (Smithsonian Institution); or a guided tour 
of the National Museum of Health and Medicine (Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Walter 
Reed Army Medical Center).  Transportation to and from the Smithsonian will be via the 
Washington METRO (with a local guide, of course!).  Transportation to and from the National 
Museum of Health and Medicine will be via a bus generously provided by the United States 
Army. Since space on the tours is limited, please indicate a first and second tour choice on the 
enclosed registration form.</P>

<P>All of us in the greater Washington area are looking forward to your visit.  If you have any 
questions, don't hesitate to contact me by email <A HREF="mailto:stephen_greenberg@nlm.nih.gov">stephen_greenberg@nlm.nih.gov</A> or by phone
