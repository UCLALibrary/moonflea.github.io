The <strong>2015 Program Committee</strong> invites ALHHS and MeMA members to take <strong>a brief survey on the program</strong> from the conference in New Haven a little more than a week ago. Please provide your feedback at: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LLZKCV6">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/LLZKCV6</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Abstracted from ALHHS-L posting by Rachel Ingold, 5 May 2015)

ALHHS President <strong>Stephen Novak</strong> appointed <strong>Lisa Mix</strong> as the new chair of the <strong>Nominations Committee</strong>. Lisa and committee members <strong>Christopher Lyons</strong> and <strong>Russell Johnson</strong> recruited a slate of members to stand for election. Barbara Niss was unanimously approved at the annual business meeting to continue as Acting Treasurer, pending the results of the annual election. In approximately two weeks, all dues-paying members will receive <strong>an invitation to cast ballots for new officers</strong> (Vice President/President-elect, Treasurer, and two Members-at-Large) via Survey Monkey. If you are not sure you have paid your membership dues for 2015, please contact our secretary, <strong>Phoebe Evans Letocha</strong> (<font color="blue">pletocha AT jhmi.edu</font>). Voting will be open for only two weeks after the Survey Monkey invitations go out. (Abstracted from ALHHS-L posting by Stephen Novak, 7 May 2015
