<P>Many ALHHS members work as archivists or special collections librarians in hospitals or medical schools.  Many either work alone or they are the only professional on a staff of two or three in an archives or special collections department, and some report not to librarians but to development officers or public relations specialists in their parent institutions.  They are responsible for reference, cataloging, conservation, and exhibits and often they are the lone voice -- and one seldom heard at the decision-making table -- for their program within their institutions.  Few archives and special collections programs are adequately funded, but the situation in the health sciences is more acute.  During the last decade or so several archives and special collections departments in hospitals and medical schools have experienced severe budget cuts.  Some programs have been shut down.  While the financial implications of recent trends in medicine have exacerbated this situation, the ahistorical culture that pervades most hospitals and medical schools is the major hurdle faced by our colleagues in their attempts to keep programs alive and well.</P>

This year's program will consist of a panel discussion on this important topic.  The panel is comprised of an archivist, three special collections librarians, and an historian of medicine who has been actively involved with a special collections program.  Each panelist has been associated with their respective institutions for ten years or more and has experienced success as well as frustration.  Despite years of experience dealing with inadequate resources and administrators who have little regard for history, each has created a record of achievement of which they can be proud.  By addressing specific issues dealing with archives and special collections in the health sciences from the perspective of their own experiences, each panelist will provide invaluable advice and guidance to ALHHS members who are working in similar environments, especially those members who are new to their positions.
