Jonathon Erlen, Curator of History of Medicine, Health Sciences Library System, University of Pittsburgh, describes his ongoing project of providing monthly listings on dissertations to twenty national/international journals and databases and his Web page Recent Dissertations in the History of Medicine. Realizing the difficulty of locating citations to dissertations unless one knows the author's name, the exact title, or the unique identifier number, Jonathan Erlen developed this unique service. </p>
