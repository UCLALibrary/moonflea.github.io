<p>
This bibliography is an outgrowth of the "Here To Go" exhibition held in the UCLA University Research Library from January through March 1998.  While the exhibition featured a selection of works by William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg from UCLA's Kurtzman Collection of Beat Literature, we have tried here to document the sum total of the UCLA University Library's holdings of works by and about Burroughs and Ginsberg. 
<p>
The bibliography is organized into five general categories for each author: Books and Pamphlets; Bibliography, Biography, and Criticism; Foreign Translations; Records and Tapes; and Miscellaneous.  Entries for items included in the Kurtzman Collection of Beat Literature are preceded with an asterisk (*).  For the most part, information in this bibliography is extracted from ORION, the UCLA Library's online information system.  While we have not examined all the items listed, we have included as much copy-specific information as we were able to draw out of ORION.  Excluded from the bibliography are: contributions by the authors to periodicals, their contributions to the works of others, and general critical works that do not feature the authors specifically.
<p>
A few words are in order about Allan Kurtzman, a kindred spirit without whom neither the exhibition nor the bibliography were likely to have come into being.  In 1988, Allan gave to the UCLA Library Department of Special Collections his rich collection of American poetry and prose by writers of the Beat Generation.  Numbering more than 1,100 items, these first and significant editions include, in addition to the work of Burroughs and Ginsberg, works by Brother Antoninus (William Everson), Kirby Congdon, Gregory Corso, Robert Duncan, Diane DiPrima, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Bob Kaufman, Jack Kerouac, Tuli Kupferberg, Jack Micheline, Michael McClure, Charles Olson, Ed Sanders, and many others.  The Library is extremely grateful for this collection.  Another of Allan Kurtzman's generous contributions to culture in Los Angeles, it creates the opportunity for important research and scholarship.  
<p>
Our work on this bibliography was facilitated immeasurably by the copyediting of Sherri Schottlaender, for which we are most grateful.  Credit is due her for the quality of the bibliographic citations; any blame for omissions or commissions is ours alone.
