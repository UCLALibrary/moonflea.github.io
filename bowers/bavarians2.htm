        I know a wasted place high in the Alps <br>
        Called Witches&#146; Kitchen. There the sun all day <br>
        With aberrant change of shadows plagues the eyes, <br>
        And when the equinoctial moon has play</font>
      <p><font size="3" face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        Upon the beast-like monoliths of stone, <br>
        The blood runs cold as its old passions rise <br>
        To haunt the memory of what we are <br>
        And what we do in worshipping brute skies. <br>
        <br>
        Below this waste of spirit and of mind <br>
        The village Holy Blood with ordered care <br>
        Was founded on deep meadows. Yearly, sheep <br>
        Are brought to graze in summer pastures there. <br>
        <br>
        Its people sow and harvest grain together <br>
        Between the comings of the winter&#146;s ice, <br>
        And when they stop to take a quick sprung flower, <br>
        Its being and their gesture will suffice <br>
        <br>
        To balance what they are and what are not. <br>
        And if we turn to look within the town <br>
        Upon a wall we find the stencilled group <br>
        Of Mary, John, and others taking down <br>
        <br>
        The body of their Master from the tree. <br>
        And just at dusk the daylight&#146;s weakened pace <br>
        Shades the blue chalk of Mary&#146;s robe with red; <br>
        And her faint tears are red upon His face.</font></p>
