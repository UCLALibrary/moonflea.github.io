      <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Walking 
        back to the office after lunch, <br>
        I saw Hans. &#147;Mister Isham, Mister Isham,&#148; <br>
        He called out in his hurry, &#147;Herr Wegner needs you.<br>
        A woman waiting for a border pass<br>
        Took poison, she is dead, and the police<br>
        Are there to take the body.&#148; In the hall,<br>
        The secretaries stood outside their doors<br>
        Silently waiting with Wegner. &#147;Sir,&#148; he said,<br>
        &#147;It was her answer on the questionaire,<br>
        A clerk for the Gestapo. So it was.&#148;<br>
        Within the outer office, by the row<br>
        Of wooden chairs, one lying on its side,<br>
        On the discolored brown linoleum floor<br>
        Under a Gl blanket was the lost <br>
        Unmoving shape; uncovered, from a fold, <br>
        A dirty foot half out of a dirty shoe, <br>
        Once white, heel bent, the sole worn through, the skin<br>
        Bruised red and calloused, uncut toenails curved<br>
        And veined like an old ivory. No one spoke.<br>
        Police stood at attention by a stretcher.<br>
        After an empty moment, suddenly <br>
        Bent over as if taken by a cramp, <br>
        I sobbed out loud and, on my uniform,<br>
        Vomited up my lunch—over the tie, <br>
        The polished buttons and insignia, <br>
        The little strips of color and the green<br>
        Eisenhower jacket with its Eagle patch, <br>
        The taut pants in a crease, the glistening jump-boots—<br>
        Vomiting and still sobbing, like a child <br>
        Awakened in the night, and sick. Wegner and Hans<br>
        Held me, murmuring, &#147;Ach, dear sir, the war <br>
        Is over and not over, such things happen.&#148; <br>
        While no one else moved, Frau Schmidt brought a towel<br>
        To clean me off before Hans walked me back,<br>
        My arm across his shoulders and I retelling <br>
        The story of how, near Zell am See, we found, <br>
        Hung from a tree in leaf, the final sack <br>
        Of bones, in rotted Wehrmacht green. In the house <br>
        An SS lord had furnished for his mistress—<br>
        Deep sofas, Persian rugs, and velvet drapes—<br>
        Frau K&ouml;nig took my clothes. In my own room, <br>
        Wearing the Gucci robe Bouchard had taken <br>
        From a fine house before we got to Ulm, <br>
        Instead of lying down to rest, I studied <br>
        The book I read for German with Frau Schmidt, <br>
        Goethe&#146;s <i>Italian Journey.</i> Through the window, <br>
        The Watchman&#146;s upper slopes were shadows, green <br>
        And purple with the afternoon, its snows <br>
        Melting, its double peaks the victory sign.</font></p>
