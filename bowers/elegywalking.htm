Past the sweet gum<br>        Superb above the cabin, along the wall&#151;<br>        Stones gathered from the level field nearby<br>        When first we cleared it. (Angry bumblebees<br>        Stung the two mules. They kicked. Thirteen, I ran.)<br>        And then the field: thread-leaf maple, deciduous<br>        Magnolia, hybrid broom, and, further down,<br>        In light shade, one Franklinia Alatamaha<br>        In solstice bloom, all white, most graciously.<br>        On the sunnier slope, the wild plums that my mother<br>        Later would make preserves of, to give to friends<br>        Or sell, in autumn, with the foxgrape, quince,<br>        Elderberry, and muscadine. Around<br>        The granite overhang, moist den of foxes;<br>        Gradually up a long hill, high in pine,<br>        Park-like, years of dry needles on the ground,<br>        And dogwood, slopes the settlers terraced; pine<br>        We cut at Christmas, berries, hollies, anise,<br>        And cones for sale in Mister Haymore&#146;s yard<br>        In town, below the Courthouse Square. James Haymore,<br>        One of the two good teachers at Boys&#146; High,<br>        Ironic and demanding, chemistry;<br>        Mary Lou Culver taught us English: essays,<br>        Plot summaries, outlines, meters, kinds of clauses<br>        (Noun, adjective, and adverb, five at a time),<br>        Written each day and then revised, and she<br>        Up half the night to read them once again<br>        Through her pince-nez, under a single lamp.<br>        Across the road, on a steeper hill, the settlers<br>        Set a house, unpainted, the porch fallen in,<br>        The road a red clay strip without a bridge,<br>        A shallow stream that liked to overflow.<br>        Oliver Brand&#146;s mules pulled our station wagon<br>        Out of the gluey mire, earth&#146;s rust. Then, here<br>        And there, back from the road, the specimen<br>        Shrubs and small trees my father planted, some<br>        Taller than we were, some in bloom, some berried,<br>        And some we still brought water to. We always<br>        Paused at the weed-filled hole beside the beech<br>        That, one year, brought forth beech nuts by the thousands,<br>        A hole still reminiscent of the man<br>        Chewing tobacco in among his whiskers<br>        My father happened on, who, discovered, told<br>        Of dreaming he should dig there for the gold<br>        And promised to give half of what he found.         </font>       <p> <font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">        During the wars with Germany and Japan,<br>        Descendents of the settlers, of Oliver Brand<br>        And of that man built Flying Fortresses<br>        For Lockheed, in Atlanta; now they build<br>        Brick mansions in the woods they left, with lawns<br>        To paved and lighted streets, azaleas, camellias<br>        Blooming among the pines and tulip trees&#151;<br>        Mercedes Benz and Cadillac Republicans.<br>        There was another stream further along <br>        Divided through a marsh, lined by the fence<br>        We stretched to posts with Mister Garner&#146;s help<br>        The time he needed cash for his son&#146;s bail<br>        And offered all his place. A noble spring<br>        Under the oak root cooled his milk and butter.<br>        He called me &#147;honey,&#148; working with us there<br>        (My father bought three acres as a gift),<br>        His wife pale, hair a country orange, voice<br>        Uncanny, like a ghost&#146;s, through the open door<br>        Behind her, chickens scratching on the floor.<br>        Barred Rocks, our chickens; one, a rooster, splendid<br>        Sliver and grey, red comb and long sharp spurs,<br>        Once chased Aunt Jennie as far as the daphne bed<br>        The two big king snakes were familiars of.<br>        My father&#146;s dog would challenge him sometimes<br>        To laughter and applause. Once, in Stone Mountain,<br>        Travelers, stopped for gas, drove off with Smokey;<br>        Angrily, grievingly, leaving his work, my father<br>        Traced the car and found them way far south,<br>        Had them arrested and, bringing Smokey home,<br>        Was proud as Sherlock Holmes, and happier.<br>        Above the spring, my sister&#146;s cats, black Amy,<br>        Grey Junior, down to meet us. The rose trees,<br>        Domestic, Asiatic, my father&#146;s favorites.<br>        The bridge, marauding dragonflies, the bullfrog,<br>        Camellias cracked and blackened by the freeze,<br>        Bay tree, mimosa, mountain laurel, apple, <br>        Monkey pine twenty feet high, banana shrub,<br>        The owls&#146; tall pine curved like a flattened S.<br>        The pump house Mort and I built block by block,<br>        Smooth concrete floor, roof pale aluminum<br>        Half-covered by a clematis, the pump <br>        Thirty feet down the mountain&#146;s granite foot.         </font>       <p> <font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">       Mort was the hired man sent to us by Fortune,<br>        Childlike enough to lead us. He brought home,<br>        Although he could not even drive a tractor,<br>        Cheated, a worthless car, which we returned.<br>        When, at the trial to garnishee his wages,<br>        Frank Guess, the judge, Grandmother&#146;s longtime neighbor,<br>        Whose children my mother taught in Cradle Roll,<br>        Heard Mort&#146;s examination, he broke in<br>        As if in disbelief on the bank&#146;s attorneys:<br>        &#147;Gentlemen, must we continue this charade?&#148;<br>        Finally, past the compost heap, the garden,<br>        Tomatoes and sweet corn for succotash,<br>        Okra for frying, Kentucky Wonders, limas,<br>        Cucumbers, squashes, leeks heaped round with soil,<br>        Lavender, dill, parsley, and rosemary,<br>        Tithonia and zinnias between the rows;<br>        The greenhouse by the rock wall, used for cuttings<br>        In late spring, frames to grow them strong for planting<br>        Through winter into summer. Early one morning<br>        Mort called out, lying helpless by the bridge.<br>        His ashes we let drift where the magnolia<br>        We planted as a stem divides the path<br>        The others lie, too young, at Silver Hill,<br>        Except my mother. Ninety-five, she lives<br>        Three thousand miles away, beside the bare<br>        Pacific, in rooms that overlook the Mission,<br>        The Riviera, and the silver range <br>        La Cumbre east. Magnolia grandiflora<br>        And one druidic live oak guard the view. <br>        Proudly around the walls, she shows her paintings<br>        Of twenty years ago: the great oak&#146;s arm<br>        Extended, Zeuslike, straight and strong, wisteria<br>        Tangled among the branches, amaryllis<br>        Around the base; her cat, UC, at ease<br>        In marigolds; the weeping cherry, pink<br>        And white arms like a blessing to the blue<br>        Bird feeder Mort made; cabin, scarlet sweet gum<br>        Superb when tribes migrated north and south.<br>        Alert, still quick of speech, a little blind,<br>        Active, ready for laughter, open to fear,<br>        Pity, and wonder that such things may be,<br>        Some Sundays, I think, she must walk the line,<br>        Aunt Jennie, too, if she were still alive,<br>        And Eleanor, whose story is untold,<br>        Their presences like muses, prompting me<br>        In my small study, all listening to the sea,<br>        All of one mind, the true posterity.</font>     </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="8">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="472"><img src="images/spacer.gif" width="40" height="45"></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="8">&nbsp;</td>    <td width="472">       <p align="left"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/blackspacer.gif" width="150" height="1"><br>        <img src="images/spacer.gif" width="40" height="20"><br>        </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From         <i>Collected Poems</i> by Edgar Bowers, published <br>        by Alfred A.
