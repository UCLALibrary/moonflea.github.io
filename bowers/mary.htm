        angel of self-discipline, her guardian<br>
        Since she first knew and had to go away<br>
        From home that spring to have her child with strangers,<br>
        Sustained her, till the vanished boy next door<br>
        And her ordeal seemed fiction, and the true<br>
        Her mother&#146;s firm insistence she was the mother<br>
        And the neighbors&#146; acquiescence. So she taught school,<br>
        Walking a mile each way to ride the street car&#151;<br>
        First books of the <i>Aeneid</i> known by heart,<br>
        French, and the French Club Wednesday afternoon;<br>
        Then summer replacement typist in an office,<br>
        Her sister&#146;s family moving in with them,<br>
        Depression years and she the only earner.<br>
        Saturday, football game and opera broadcasts,<br>
        Sunday, staying at home to wash her hair,<br>
        The Business Women&#146;s Circle Monday night,<br>
        And, for a treat, birthdays and holidays,<br>
        Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald.<br>
        The young blond sister long since gone to college,<br>
        Nephew and nieces gone, her mother dead,<br>
        Instead of Caesar, having to teach First Aid,<br>
        The students rowdy, she retired. The rent<br>
        For the empty rooms she gave to Thornwell Orphanage,<br>
        Unwed Mothers, Temperance, and Foster Parents<br>
        And never bought the car she meant to buy;<br>
        Too blind at last to do much more than sit<br>
        All day in the antique glider on the porch<br>
        Listening to cars pass up and down the street.<br>
        Each summer, on the grass behind the house&#151;<br>
        Cape jasmine, with its scent of August nights<br>
        Humid and warm, the soft magnolia bloom<br>
        Marked lightly by a slow brown stain&#151;she spread,<br>
        For airing, the same small intense collection,<br>
        Concert programs, worn trophies, years of yearbooks,<br>
        Letters from schoolgirl chums, bracelets of hair<br>
        And the same picture: black hair in a bun,<br>
        Puzzled eyes in an oval face as young<br>
        Or old as innocence, skirt to the ground,<br>
        And, seated on the high school steps, the class,<br>
        The ones to whom she would have said, <i>&#147;Seigneur,<br>
        Donnez-nous la force de supporter<br>
        La peine</i>,<i>&#148;</i> as an example easy to remember,<br>
