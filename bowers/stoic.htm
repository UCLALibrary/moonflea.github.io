        winter long you listened for the boom <br>
        Of distant cannon wheeled into their place. <br>
        Sometimes outside beneath a bombers&#146; moon <br>
        You stood alone to watch the searchlights trace <br>
        <br>
        Their careful webs against the boding sky, <br>
        While miles away on Munich&#146;s vacant square <br>
        The bombs lunged down with an unruly cry <br>
        Whose blast you saw yet could but faintly hear. <br>
        <br>
        And might have turned your eyes upon the gleam <br>
        Of a thousand years of snow, where near the clouds <br>
        The Alps ride massive to their full extreme, <br>
        And season after season glacier crowds <br>
        <br>
        The dark, persistent smudge of conifers. <br>
        Or seen beyond the hedge and through the trees <br>
        The shadowy forms of cattle on the furze, <br>
        Their dim coats white with mist against the freeze. <br>
        <br>
        Or thought instead of other times than these, <br>
        Of other countries and of other sights: <br>
        Eternal Venice sinking by degrees <br>
        Into the very water that she lights; <br>
        <br>
        Reflected in canals, the lucid dome <br>
        Of Maria della Salute at your feet, <br>
        Her triple spires disfigured by the foam. <br>
        Remembered in Berlin the parks, the neat <br>
        <br>
        Footpaths and lawns, the clean spring foliage, <br>
        Where just short weeks before, a bomb, unaimed, <br>
        Released a frightened lion from its cage, <br>
        Which in the mottled dark that trees enflamed<br>
        <br>
        Killed one who hurried homeward from the raid. <br>
        And by yourself there standing in the chill <br>
        You must, with so much known, have been afraid <br>
        And chosen such a mind of constant will, <br>
        <br>
        Which, though all time corrode with constant hurt, <br>
        Remains, until it occupies no space, <br>
        That which it is; and passionless, inert, <br>
        Becomes at last no meaning and no place.</font>
