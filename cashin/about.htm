      face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size=3>onnie Cashin (1908-2000) was 
      one of the foremost American fashion designers in the second half of the 
      twentieth century. At the vanguard of her field for nearly forty years, 
      she had an enormous influence on twentieth-century design. Her oft-stated 
      credo "Chic is where you find it," sums up her belief that designers 
      should possess a habit of wonder and an ability to connect the fashion 
      world with objects and ideas not usually associated with it. <BR><BR>In 
      the summer of 2003, the Department of Special Collections in the UCLA 
      Charles E. Young Research Library acquired the Bonnie Cashin Archive as a 
      gift from the Cashin Estate. In addition to Cashin's personal papers, the 
      Estate provided an endowment to establish the Bonnie Cashin Lecture 
      Series. The series brings to UCLA gifted individuals from a variety of 
      disciplines to celebrate the creative process, and to preserve the legacy 
      of Cashin's remarkable life and work</FONT>
