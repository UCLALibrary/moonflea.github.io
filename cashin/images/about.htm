        Cashin (1908-2000) was one of the foremost American fashion designers 
        in the second half of the twentieth century. At the vanguard of her field 
        for nearly forty years, she had an enormous influence on twentieth-century 
        design. Her oft-stated credo "Chic is where you find it," sums up her 
        belief that designers should possess a habit of wonder and an ability 
        to connect the fashion world with objects and ideas not usually associated 
        with it. <br>
        <br>
        In the summer of 2003, the Department of Special Collections in the UCLA 
        Charles E. Young Research Library acquired the Bonnie Cashin Archive as 
        a gift from the Cashin Estate. In addition to Cashin's personal papers, 
        the Estate provided an endowment to establish the Bonnie Cashin Lecture 
        Series. The series brings to UCLA gifted individuals from a variety of 
        disciplines to celebrate the creative process, and to preserve the legacy 
        of Cashin's remarkable life and work</font> </p>
