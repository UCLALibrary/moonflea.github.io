    <td valign="top"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though four centuries divide the works of poet/priest John Donne from artist/agnostic June Wayne, her 1959 livre d'artiste <em>John Donne: Songs and Sonets</em> has become a testament to art's ability to reconcile disparate times and beliefs.  In nuanced, cosmological interpretations of love, the fifteen lithographs Wayne created for the book reflect upon both her and Donne's engagement with the science of their days: the physicists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory for Wayne, Galileo for Donne.  Printed in France and Germany, it was this work that led to the Ford Foundation's support of the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, reviving the nearly extinct art of lithography in the United States.<br>
        <br>
Since her first solo exhibition at age seventeen in Chicago, Wayne's curiosity about physical and biological sciences, from the genetic code to earthquakes, tsunamis, and the workings of the cosmos, has been a constant.  Though always an outspoken defender of the arts, from battling McCarthyism in the 1950s to tangling publicly with Jesse Helms at the Metropolitan Museum in the early '90s, she has never let her focus shift away from her artist-self, expressed through different aesthetic concepts and media.<br>
<br>
Over the course of her long career, Wayne has achieved legendary status for her multiple talents ranging from the visual arts to writing and public speaking.  It is, however, her vast body of lithographs and the enduring influence she left as she pushed against the boundaries of the medium that have been the source of her greatest critical recognition.  Indeed, she has been called by Jorge de Sousa "the incontestable pioneer of contemporary lithography."</font></td>
