            <strong><font size="2">Bonnie Cashin's Paper-Route to Fashion</font><br>
            (press release written by Bonnie Cashin, 1965)</strong> <br>
            <br>
            Bonnie's involvement with paper began in 1953, by falling in love 
            with a paper bag. Journeying from her studio up the Hudson, where 
            she worked, to her New York apartment, the big paper bag, full of 
            drawings, swatches, etc., became almost a trademark. As there weren't 
            pretty ones to buy then, she made special ones for herself out of 
            bright papers. (A few years later she made them in leather, and you 
            know how contagious those became!) <br>
            <br>
            The paper bag led to a whole series of experiments . ideas for all 
            kinds of accessories, for men's, women's, and children's clothing, 
            for industrial uses, and all sorts of things for modern living. The 
            probe progressed on two levels, A . Designs to wear and use to solve 
            the problem of freedom from a certain kind of slavery . washing and 
            cleaning. The objective was honest function, basic as a bag . pin-money 
            cost . good color, texture and shape . really throw-away chic. B . 
            The second level of experiments was paper simply used as an interesting 
            creative medium in itself . disposability not the objective . let 
            price fall where it may . let the concepts make their own fashion 
            statement in a fresh way. <br>
            <br>
            Exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts' "Made With Paper" 
            show are several prototypes of Bonnie's designs for this second level 
            of experiments. One is a tufted paper coat, conceived for cold weather 
            insulation. Another, a tunic, is made not of real paper, but a paper-like 
            non-woven stuff, and it's hand-knitted. There are several fold-flatable 
            knitted head-gear for fun and sun times, and one folded paper board 
            hat that is meant to be disposable. <br>
            <br>
            Never a buttons-and-bows gimmick girl, the first level of concepts, 
            Bonnie feels, must be implemented by new machinery and techniques 
            in order to function in a valid way and prove practical for marketing. 
            One of the several problems not quite yet conquered is the proper 
            heat-sealing techniques. Bonnie feels confident it will come . that 
            the imaginative designer can be the catalyst between the huge paper 
            industry and technology to make new things for tomorrow's living all 
            come true. As Bonnie says ".almost anything can happen . it's all 
            fabulously exciting!" <br>
