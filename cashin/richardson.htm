      <strong>Peter Richardson</strong> <font size="2"> is editorial director
      at PoliPointPress and lectures on California culture at San Francisco State
      University. His most recent book, <em>American Prophet: The Life and Work
      of Carey McWilliams</em>, is the first book-length study of California's
      shrewdest observer. <br>
      <br>
      Richardson began work on <em>American Prophet </em>in 2001. Drawing on a
      variety of sources, including primary materials in the Carey McWilliams
      Collection at the Charles E. young Research Library Department of Special
      Collections, he completed his research in 2004. <em>American Prophet</em>
      appeared in October 2005 and has been praised by veteran journalist Lou
      Cannon, author Mike Davis, Victor Navasky of <em>The Nation</em>, professor
      and former U.S. ambassador Derek Shearer, historian Kevin Starr, and other
      McWilliams aficionados.<br>
      <br>
      Richardson has served as editor at the Public Policy Institute of California,
      associate professor of English at the University of North Texas, and acquisitions
      editor at Harper and Row Publishers. A Fulbright Senior Scholar in 1994
      and a National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Seminar Fellow at Harvard
      University in 1993, he holds a PhD in English from the University of California,
      Berkeley, and a BA in economics from the University of California, Santa
      Barbara. His other publications include numerous books, monographs, and
      articles on language, literature, and California public policy. His Web
      log, <a href="http://www.peterrichardson.blogspot.com">peterrichardson.blogspot.com</a>,
      hosts an informal discussion of McWilliams and his work. </font>
