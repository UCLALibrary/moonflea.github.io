<img src="../images/jay.jpg" align=left align=texttop hspace=10><font size="+2" color="660033">Ricky Jay</font>
<br>
<font size="+1"> 
December 10, 2001<br>
4-6 p.m.</font><p>
<font size="-1"><b>RSVP by December 5 to 310/206-2181</font></b>
<p> 
Sleight-of-hand artist, actor, scholar of the unusual and author of the recently published <font size="+1">Jay's Journal of Anomalies</font> (Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 2001) will join us for an afternoon of conversation on December 10, 2001 from 4-6 p.m. in the Department of Special Collections.  He will sign copies of <i>Jay's Journal of Anomalies</i>, which will be available for sale.<p>
About the book, his publisher says,
 "The multitalented Ricky Jay...wrote and published a unique and beautifully designed quarterly called <i>Jay's Journal of Anomalies</i>. Already coveted collector's items, the sixteen issues are now gathered in a complete set, with significant new material and illustrations. A brilliant excursion into the history of bizarre entertainments, the journal was described in The New York Times as "beautiful and elegant . . . a combination of rigorous scholarship and personal rumination.""<p>
Mr. Jay's one-man show, <i>Ricky Jay & His 52 Assistants</i>, received the Lucille Lortel and Obie awards, and set a record as the fastest-selling show in off-Broadway history. Mr. Jay is the author of <i>The Magic Magic Book</i>, <i>Cards As Weapons</i>, and <i>Learned Pigs &amp Fireproof Women</i>. He has written and hosted his own television specials for CBS, HBO, A&E, and the BBC. Movie audiences will know Mr. Jay from his roles in David Mamet's films <i>House of Games</i>, <i>Things Change</i>, <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i>, <i>State and Main</i>, and the recently released <i>Heist</i>. He has also appeared in <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i>, <i>Boogie Nights</i>, and <i>Magnolia</i>.

Special Collections holdings are featured in two important Los Angeles exhibits: 
<p>
 
<font size="+1">The Armenian Gospels of Gladzor</font><br>
September 11-December 2, 2001 at the Getty Center.<br>  Details at <a href="http://www.getty.edu">www.getty.edu.</a> 
<p>
This exhibition offers a rare opportunity to see more than 60 pages of the Gladzor Gospels, one of the masterpieces of Armenian illumination of the 14th century. It also introduces the manuscript's illuminators, and its place within Western European, Byzantine, and Islamic artistic traditions. The exhibition focuses on the particularly Armenian view of Christ's life expressed in the manuscript's miniatures. The manuscript is on loan from the UCLA Library's Department of Special Collections especially for this exhibition, which commemorates the 1700th anniversary of the founding of the Armenian Church. 
<p>

 
 
<font size="+1">The World from Here: Treasures of the Great Libraries of Los Angeles</font><br>
October 17, 2001 - January 13, 2002 at UCLA Hammer Museum.<br>
Details at <a href="http://www.hammer.ucla.edu">www.hammer.ucla.edu</a><p>

Amidst metropolitan Los Angeles' superabundance of cultural offerings, the extraordinary holdings of area libraries are commonly overlooked. Aside from a relatively small number of book specialists and scholars, few people are aware of Los Angeles' vast collective resource of rare books, manuscripts, and related objects, which have arrived here from every quarter of the globe. The World from Here is a collaborative project that aims to involve up to forty area institutions in a dramatic and informative presentation of special collections materials in order to establish a prominent profile - locally, nationally, and internationally - for this impressive, yet little known, cultural resource. In promoting an awareness of what L.A.'s libraries have to offer, this project will increase its audiences' appreciation of the collections and encourage their public use. The World from Here is comprised of a tripartite program that includes a major exhibition, an extensive catalogue, and a full complement of educational programs.

        <p> <a href=http://ipr.ues.gseis.ucla.edu/><font size="+1"> UCLA Institute on Primary Resources</font></a>
        <p>
The Institute on Primary Resources is sponsored by Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School and the Department of Special Collections.                     The purpose of the Institute is to introduce teachers to resources available in the Department of Special Collections and how they can                         be used in the K-12 classroom. Teachers may use any of the materials from the extensive holdings of the Department, however the main focus of the Institute is                            on the use of primary source material.
