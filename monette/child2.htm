      Letter to Paul Monette from Avon editorial director Robert B. Wyatt. He 
      gives details of the design and marketing of <em>The Gold Diggers</em>. 
      It is not stated that this is as a "gay novel," but it seems slanted to 
      the emerging gay market. The design is stylish Art Deco and the cover illustration 
      is by Stavrinos. He was also doing an illustration for an excerpt of the 
      novel being published in the gay lifestyle and erotica journal <em>Blueboy</em>.
