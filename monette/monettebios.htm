              BACHARDY</strong> is one of the most distinguished of American portrait 
              artists. A Los Angeles area native, he attended UCLA and then studied 
              at Chouinard Art Institute, Los Angeles, and at the Slade School 
              of Art, London. He has had shows in numerous major galleries, museums, 
              and libraries, including, most recently, the Huntington Library, 
              Pasadena, which houses the papers of his longtime lover, Christopher 
              Isherwood. His work resides in numerous collections, for example, 
              The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, the Smithsonian Institution, 
              Washington, D.C., and the National Portrait Gallery, London. His 
              official portrait of former Gov. Jerry Brown hangs in the California 
              State Capitol. His work has been published in numerous exhibit catalogs 
              and journal articles, on dust jackets of authors from E.M. Forster 
              to Gavin Geoffrey Dillard, in promotions for motion pictures such 
              as Robert Altman&#8217;s <em>Short Cuts</em>, collected in books 
              by Twelvetrees Press, and in <em>Stars in My Eyes</em>. He is president 
              of the Board of Directors of the Isherwood Foundation. The UCLA 
              Library has long held his portraits of Gerald Heard, Ana&iuml;s 
              Nin, and Aldous Huxley. On the occasion of this exhibit and conference 
              Bachardy has donated to the Library one of his portraits of Paul 
              Monette, used for this website. It is rare for Bachardy to have 
              used only black and white in a portrait at this point in his career, 
              as he has done in this pensive and revealing study of Monette. He 
              lives in Santa Monica. <br>

              Psychological Association since 1964. She is a longtime activist 
              and the editor of the pioneering work, <em>Positively Gay</em>, 
              first published in 1979 and still in print in its third edition. 
              Her recent memoir, <em>Surviving Madness</em>, won the Lambda Literary 
              Award. Other works include <em>Permanent Partners: Building Gay 
              and Lesbian Relationships that Last</em> and <em>Setting Them Straight: 
              You Can Do Something about Bigotry and Homophobia in Your Life</em>. 
              She was the National President, Gay Academic Union, 1977-1979 and 
              has served on numerous boards, such as that of the Los Angeles Gay

              Lesbian Writers Group, which included Malcolm Boyd, Katherine V. 
              Forrest, Michael Nava, Mark Thompson, and Paul Monette, among others, 
              first met at her house. Monette&#8217;s difficult poems written 
              after the death of Roger Horwitz were shown to Berzon, who recognized 
              the necessity and aptness of this bold new style Monette cultivated 
              for what would become <em>Love Alone: 18 Elegies for Rog</em>. Berzon 
              lives in Los Angeles with her partner Teresa DeCrescenzo, director 
              of the Gay and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services (GLASS). </font></p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">

              with Paul Monette and this exhibit and conference. When Monette 
              was no longer able to write after the death of Roger Horwitz, it 
              was to his notebook alone that he confided his rough drafts of poems 
              in a challenging new style. He then shared these and other drafts 
              with his poet friend Muske-Dukes, transferring them to UCLA in a 
              folder labeled &#8220;Carol poems.&#8221; The process of sharing 
              and writing new poems with Monette has been written about by Muske-Dukes 
              most beautifully in her essay, &#8220;All Through the Night.&#8221;
