              early as in interviews following publication of his first novel, 
              <em>Taking Care of Mrs Carroll </em>(1978), Paul Monette was articulating 
              his move from writing poetry to writing fiction. He later speaks 
              of Roger Horwitz's encouraging him to write more poetry, but he 
              didn't until the devastation of AIDS killing Horwitz and infecting 
              himself.<br><br>
              Shown here are the journal pages in which Monette wrote in furious 
              heat what would become "Here," the first poem in <em>Love Alone: 
              18 Elegies to Rog</em> (1988). At the same time as drafting the 
              elegies in the journals, Monette was writing other poems, which 
              he kept in a folder labeled "Carol poems," which he shared with 
              Los Angeles poet and USC professor Carol Muske-Dukes. Those not 
              elegies to Horwitz were not published or collected until later.<br><br>
			   
              The daughter of Muske-Dukes was seriously ill at the time Roger 
              was ill, and she and Monette shared poems expressing their anxiety 
              and grief. She has written touchingly about this process and quotes 
              her own work and Monette's work in an essay about this: "[G]rave 
              frightening love poems and angry poems began to flow from Paul." 
              She quotes from Monette's "The Worrying":<dir><p align="left">around the house with 
              a rag of ammonia<br>wiping wiping crazed as a housewife on Let's<br>Make 
              a Deal the deal being PLEASE DON'T MAKE<br>HIM SICK AGAIN .</p>
            </dir>Monette stated that "Carol proved to be the one who saved me 
            as a writer." Several of these poems were begun in holograph in the 
            journals and then made into a neat typescript yet half completed. 
            The typescripts were added to again in holograph until completed. 
            This remarkable group of manuscripts directs his venom at political 
            and cultural figures and forces which together hampered research and 
            treatment of AIDS and the treatment of gay men in particular. He wrote 
            poems criticizing William Buckley, Rudolf Nureyev's staying in the 
            closet (even briefly-through his doctor-after death), and the U.S. 
            Supreme Court's demeaning decision in <em>Bowers v Hardwick</em> that 
            upheld sodomy laws against homosexuals. Monette of course didn't live 
            to see this overturned in 2003 with the majority opinion that the 
            justices had been wrong. Even today states refuse to abide by this 
            Supreme Court decision, and Monette would have even more to write 
            about.<br><br>Monette put his protest at the heart of his new work. In a 
            still unpublished poem from this group he excoriates even his own 
            early poetry and poet friends who rejected his new direction as not 
            even being "poetry." The Carol poem entitled "Those Back East" continues, 
            "with their head up their ass will all have / tenure soon and lean 
            more easterly / every day ." In this work he denigrates subject matter 
            "safe to write" such as nature description or easy self-pity compressed 
            in the parody lines "leafsong gooseflight / frost why me." He saw 
            this style as a retreat to how he himself had written in his early 
            works, with subjects that were "nature" and "poetic" expressed with 
            clever wordplay. He needed now to reflect a world as harsh as his 
            life with AIDS had become and with a style appropriate to that truth.
