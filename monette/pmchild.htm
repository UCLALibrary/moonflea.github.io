              the moment Paul Monette moved with Roger Horwitz to Los Angeles 
              and Monette published his first novel, <em>Taking Care of Mrs. Carroll</em> 
              (1978), he "went Hollywood." He later wrote that he was a "child 
              of Hollywood," raised on movies. His next two novels dissect the 
              world that is a beacon to so many, including, of course, gay males.<br>
              <br>
              <em>Mrs. Carroll</em> had an actress as one main character, and 
              his second and third novels, <em>The Gold Diggers</em> (1979) and 
              <em>The Long Shot</em> (1981), are set in Hollywood and Los Angeles. 
              Up until the 1970s, with publishing and reviewing centered in the 
              east, few novels were set on the west coast. Los Angeles critic, 
              writer, and UCLA professor Carolyn See was among the first to study 
              the Hollywood novel, the subject of her 1963 UCLA dissertation in 
              English. She was among the first in her generation actually to set 
              books in Los Angeles. In the late 1930s F. Scott Fitzgerald had 
              written his unfinished Hollywood studio novel, <em>The Last Tycoon</em>, 
              and Nathanael West published <em>The Day of the Locust</em>. Gay 
              writers set novels or parts of novels in Los Angeles and Hollywood: 
              Gore Vidal's <em>The City and the Pillar</em> (1948) and <em>Myra 
              Breckinridge</em> (1968), Gavin Lambert's <em>The Slide Area</em> 
              (1958), John Rechy's <em>City of Night</em> (1963), and Christopher 
              Isherwood's <em>A Single Man</em> (1964). Isherwood was the most 
              prominent gay resident writer of Los Angeles until his death in 
              1986. Monette's Hollywood books follow in this tradition.<br>
              <br>
              Throughout the rest of his writing career, Monette used the varying 
              moods of the city of Los Angeles as a subtext of his works, as a 
              symbolic background, and even an actor in the works themselves. 
              He has noted that summer&#8212;what most think is the one season 
              of Los Angeles&#8212;is important in his work since he was raised in the 
              cold on the east coast.<br>
              <br>
              Monette's work as a free-lance screenwriter and in making novelizations 
              of others' screenplays gave him insider locations and information 
              for his own fiction. He made novels from the movies <em>Nosferatu</em> 
              (1979), <em>Scarface </em>(1983), <em>Predator</em> (1987), <em>Midnight 
              Run</em> (1990), and <em>Havana</em> (1991). A photograph shows 
              an advertisement for Monette's adaptation of <em>Scarface</em> on 
              a billboard on the north side of Sunset Boulevard, just one block 
              east of King's Road, leading up to his house. UCLA has long collected 
              movie tie-in literature, but Monette seems to have left no manuscripts 
              for these works, and thus there is no way to study how he composed 
              them.<br>
              <br>
              Constructions of motion picture plots also supported Monette's larger 
              writing purposes. Since he wanted to write about love and relationships, 
              he mixed the Hollywood genres of romance and screwball comedy. Critic 
              David Román has noted Monette's use of comedy in an almost Shakespearean 
              way. The novels proceed with dizzying plot complications, genders 
              are confused, but loose ends are resolved and characters come together 
              as they do in the world of comedy. This suited Monette's ideas of 
              presenting in a positive light gay men's relationships as they were 
              being developed and defined through the 1970s and into the 1980s.<br>
              <br>
              Notes for <em>The Gold Diggers</em> show Monette's interests both 
              in Los Angeles history and setting with notes for a "Spanish house" 
              that is "in the cleft between two shadowed hills" and that "was 
              bought from the estate of an old-time silent screen actor who built 
              it in the teens or 20's and lived in it for 50 or 55 years." Notes 
              about the protagonist show his continuing to work against the stereotypes 
              of gay men: "From L.A., coolly muscular body, has always been on 
              top of things, didn't have a stressful growing-up as a gay man-<em>hunky</em>."<br>
              <br>
              Prior to gay liberation, no one would think of describing a gay 
              male as "hunky," not even gay men themselves. With Monette's work 
              and the work of illustrators and artists, this was changing in the 
              1970s. Among those influential illustrators was Stavrinos. A representative 
              sample of his gay male imagery can be seen in the work on display, 
              editors Dennis Sanders's and Michael Emory's <em>Gay Source: A Catalog 
              for Men</em> (1977). This book is a Whole Earth-style catalog for 
              the gay male with Stavrinos's illustrations of "hunky" men.<br>
              <br>
              <em>The Gold Diggers</em> was issued in paper wrappers by a mainstream 
              publisher, Avon Books. Letters from Monette's editor show the thought 
              behind the design, noting the typeface and cover would share an 
              Art Deco influence, popular in revival at that time, and that "Stavrinos 
              is starting from scratch on the cover." He depicted portraits of 
              attractive young men, suitable to Monette's characters. The book 
              remains a landmark design in presenting gay male literature.<br>
              <br>
              While Monette's screenplays were never produced, he earned enough 
              money along with Horwitz to live modestly but stylishly well. They 
              bought a house at 1500 North Kings Road, now West Hollywood, and 
              Monette set part of his third novel, also involving Hollywood history 
              and gay men, there. Stars had lived on Kings Road. Sketches and 
              notes for his third novel, <em>The Long Shot</em>, show the outlines 
              of the Kings Road house. Monette's third novel, <em>Lightfall</em> 
              (1982), was an anomaly, written because his publishers thought he 
              had been writing too many gay novels. Monette couldn't have known 
              that calamity would keep him from writing fiction for eight years.
