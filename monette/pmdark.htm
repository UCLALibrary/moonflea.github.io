              Monette's last essays, including "Puck," benefited from his celebrity 
              as National Book Award-winner. They were featured prominently in 
              gay magazines before being collected as <em>Last Watch of the Night</em> 
              (1994). They are also poignant to be shown in their creation. He 
              had always written drafts in longhand, and some of these last works 
              were written on his usual lined pads when he was traveling by ship. 
              He noted in one the difficulty of traveling with so much medicine 
              and even IVs. The essays make up the third book of his non-fiction 
              works, works all too brief to make up the second half of his life 
              story.<br>
              <br>
              He writes of domestic things, of Puck and Buddy, his (and Roger 
              Horwitz's) and Winston Wilde's dogs: "Nights we stay up later than 
              Buddy and Winston, a couple of hours at least. Buddy curls in his 
              basket under the bedroom window.." The setting of this essay is 
              still Kings Road and gives a fullness to its geography in terms 
              equal to those Isherwood achieved when writing of the Hollywood 
              hills and Santa Monica mountains in <em>A Single Man</em>.<br>
              <br>
              In an interview when publishing <em>Afterlife</em>, Monette noted: 
              "We must put more of one another in our books." He included a diversity 
              of LGBT persons by writing of his friendships with lesbians, particularly 
              the enchanting story of Gert Macy. Although she lived a closeted 
              life in the 1930s and 1940s in the New York theater world as the 
              lover of actress Katherine Cornell, she was still a beacon for Monette 
              and Horwitz when they knew her in the mid 1970s. A photo of Macy 
              shows her with Robert Benchley at what seems to be the nightclub 
              at The Martinique Hotel on Broadway in New York City in the late 
              1930s. She is also shown at what is most likely her bohemian summer 
              cottage on Martha's Vineyard at about the same time. These photographs 
              give an amplitude to the past history of LGBT persons. A sense of 
              time seems to flow through these photographs preserved by Macy's 
              adoring niece, Merloyd Lawrence. Often much is destroyed by family 
              when a single LGBT person dies, but Lawrence's reminiscences and 
              Monette's tribute preserve Macy's heritage. It is one of Monette's 
              final depictions of the generations of LGBT persons and what can 
              be learned from each other. The essay suggests the end of his first 
              novel, when the protagonist asks how the older Madeleine felt about 
              her life. In "Gert," Monette begins the essay: "'Does it go too 
              fast?' I asked her." Writer John Preston included "Gert" in a volume 
              of essays by lesbians about gay men and gay men about lesbians and 
              noted to Monette that "Gert" was "a masterpiece, a memoir so laser 
              sharp in its center that it left me quite speechless when I first 
              read it."<br>
              <br>
         	Monette wrote again about Greece and its continuing meaning to him and his work. He also preserved his meditations on the graves of Keats and Shelley and the graves of Horwitz and Stephen Kolzak. In the most intriguing turn of all, "My Priests" is a groping toward a spirituality that was outside the establishment religions he so protested.<br><br>
              He selected poems for an elegant volume, <em>West of Yesterday, 
              East of Summer: New and Selected Poems </em>1973-1993 (1994), writing 
              an introduction detailing his life in poetry. It publishes the works 
              with the most recent printed first, and that first group of poems 
              includes "Stephen at the FDA." A holograph draft was found among 
              the manuscript pages of <em>Afterlife</em>. Thinking about Kolzak 
              when writing the novel seems to have turned Monette's creative mind 
              back to the protest in Washington, D.C.<br>
              <br>    
	Monette had published some of the Carol poems which were not elegies to Roger Horwitz in literary journals. The author Lev Raphael wrote of "Buckley": "At last someone's skewered that Creature . . . as he deserves. I read the poem in a headlong burst, hurtled on by the glorious rage.." Among the newer poems was "Committing to Memory (For Winston)."<br><br>        
	Monette titled the proposal for the work he wanted to accomplish next "Seeing in the Dark." This work was to have built on the success of his prior essays. He devised intriguing essays on Audrey Hepburn's work to save the world's children and on Madeleine Follain, a French friend of Horwitz's whom Monette had also met. He noted that he would have his usual activist message: "As if I could write any book any more that didn't contain the requisite vituperations against the Pope, the televangelists and the ever-milling crowd of seamy politicos." But he also wanted to try something new, fables for gays and lesbians, "a story or two worthy of being told around the tribal campfire."<br><br>
              He previewed the only one of these fables he had time to complete 
              by reading from it himself at a GLAAD benefit honoring him shortly 
              before his death. <em>Sanctuary</em> was edited and published posthumously 
              in 1997 by his literary executor, David Groff. <br>
              <br>
	Monette had used the story of Greek warriors to describe his and Horwitz's battle together against AIDS. In the fable he returns to this image, when two female animals, a fox and a hare love same-sex and across species and are fearing attacks: "They embraced with the fervor of a couple of soldiers set to do battle the next day."
