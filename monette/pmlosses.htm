This meant his literary output was closeted as well, although several poems express his desire to be more uninhibited, a trait he associated with the men on whom he had crushes, most of them straight. An unpublished 1967 poem is "For Bill," probably Bill Hilgendorf, his fellow Elihu member at Yale and boyfriend of Star Black. It begins: "What gave away so much of us to us?" He adds to and alters this line for meaning and flow but almost unconsciously leaves in the sense of having something to hide. <br><br> 
	Several early poems have protagonists who are barely disguised masks of his desire.  "Drifter" depicts an uninhibited young man, and the poet admonishes the reader:<dir><p align="left"> 
		.Do not<br>
		die in this firm house. Leave, give chase,<br>
		the troubadours and traveling men survive.</p></dir> 

	Lines of another poem give even more of a sense of things hidden, things misrepresented. In this 1970s poem, he does seem ready to acknowledge the pain of the closet's deceptions, even if he is not completely aware of the cause:<dir><p align="left"> 
		October's just October, its twilight feel,<br>
		its way of dying out something to invent.<br><br>

		When I am with my friends, I can describe<br>
		leaves piling like anybody: I've hid my losses<br>
		in those brief lies.</p>
            </dir>Monette's early work received good distribution for a beginning 
            poet, with selections published in <em>The Yale Lit</em> and in privately 
            published volumes. A friend issued the poems inspired by Walden in 
            a small chapbook, <em>Come Spring</em>, closeted work that was another 
            inkling of coming out yet to occur, both for the poet and his subject, 
            when in later years critics would name Thoreau as "gay."<br><br>
            <em>Sarah</em> (1970) was published with illustrations by David Schorr, 
            one of Monette's earliest and longest-lasting friends. It was reviewed 
            in his hometown newspaper with a featured photograph of the poet: 
            "The poet is young and can hold a fascinating conversation on the 
            character of art in the twentieth century and digs what he's doing 
            with his life." The article gives quotes about a novel he has been 
            working on and even a screenplay "which may be sold soon."<br><br>
			Monette 
            visited San Juan, Puerto Rico, setting two poems there. The unpublished 
            poem refers to women tourists "at the Caribe Hilton." The poem also 
            suggests the feeling of being in the closet, a Cavafy-like expression 
            that one can't change or hide one's true nature even though changing 
            cities or traveling:<dir><p align="left">Above them the palms shake like<br> shredded bells. 
            Even here<br>they will always be what<br>they always are .</p></dir>
			 During these 
            years, he made friendships with several east coast gay men who were 
            or would soon become prominent writers and poets, such as Richard 
            Howard, J.D. (Sandy) McClatchy, and Sanford Freidman. Through McClatchy 
            he was introduced to the older gay poet James Merrill in a meeting 
            which didn't take. McClatchy has recorded the differences in temperament 
            that would propel Monette away from the "east coast" poetry all the 
            way across the country to Los Angeles and a different kind of writing 
            altogether.<br><br>
            Richard Howard wrote Monette after <em>The Looker-On: Fra Angelico, 
            Crucifixion, About 1450</em> was published around 1973 as a chapbook. 
            Howard gives praise and then criticism: "Focus, my dear, is not, here, 
            your strong point .."<br><br>
            Monette's early poems were collected by the Boston publisher Little, 
            Brown in 1975 and published as <em>The Carpenter in the Asylum</em>. 
            He had arrived as a poet. </font></font><br>
