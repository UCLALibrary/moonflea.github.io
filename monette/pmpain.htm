            Joseph Cady has labeled two kinds of AIDS writing as immersive and 
            counterimmersive. Paul Monette's is of the first category and demands 
            that the reader look at and experience the pain of the disease instead 
            of a distancing "leafsong gooseflight / frost why me." <br>
            <br>
            Monette realized that in going back to poetry, he would have to have 
            a different style. The words aggregate on the page and must be read 
            in a rush, a fury that was held by Monette himself. Monette addressed 
            this difference in style even in the poems themselves, as in "Gardenias":<dir> 
            <p align="left"> pain is not a flower pain is a root<br>
              and its work is underground where the moldering<br>
              proceeds the bones of all our joy winded</p>
            </dir>Los Angeles psychotherapist and writer Betty Berzon recognized 
            the aptness of this style when she was shown the poems, probably before 
            publication: "[E]ach time I find [the elegies] richer and more powerfu&#8212;-and 
            not quite as painful as at that shock of first reading.. I think you 
            are right in the lack of punctuation. Ideas, emotions, images, are 
            pushing one another across the page-no time for commas here."<br>
            <br>
            Writer Gregory Kolovakos, who also had AIDS, expressed in a letter 
            to Monette the divisions Monette dramatized. Kolovakos was on the 
            side of immersive writing and was also impatient with the gay community's 
            often too polite behavior. His sympathies were with Monette and ACT 
            UP founder Larry Kramer, whose art turned political instead of writing 
            in a less harsh style about AIDS, the counterimmersive style identified 
            by Cady.<br>
            <br>
            Monette's early poet friend J.D. McClatchy wrote of this division 
            between himself and Monette and didn't respond to Monette's newer 
            poetry, saying that Monette's choosing to be political and to express 
            his rage diminished his art: "Art's afterlife eluded him."<br>
            <br>
            Monette again benefited from the array of gay publishing available 
            ten years after publication of his first gay novel and at almost the 
            end of the second decade of gay liberation literature. <em>Christopher 
            Street</em> advertised its publication of selections from the elegies 
            on the cover of issue 119, using a snapshot of Monette and Horwitz 
            taken in Italy as illustration. Mark Thompson, then an editor at <em>The 
            Advocate</em>, reluctantly rejected the offered poems, since the <em>Advocate</em>'s 
            policy was never to publish poetry. <em>The American Poetry Review</em> 
            and others accepted selections from the work. Editor Michael Denneny 
            published the entire cycle at St. Martin's Press, again using the 
            snapshot, this time in color, for the dust jacket.<br>
            <br>
            Monette thus had a large audience for something as difficult as his 
            late poetry with its raging subject matter and the bald and austere 
            style that he created in order to project this. Kolovakos wrote Monette: 
            "I keep buying copies so that friends will have to confront what you're 
            saying." For a book of poems written for the gay community, Monette 
            received dozens of fan letters, probably almost unheard-of for most 
            poets to receive other than from a few fellow poets and friends and 
            students.<br>
            <br>
            Fellow poets, such as Alex Gildzen, did write with praise: "Today 
            y[ou]r grief became mine because in reading y[ou]r poem cycle I was 
            permitted to share what was a great love." Gildzen later composed 
            "Summer's End," a brief lyric which complements Monette's summer imagery.<br>
            <br>
            The influence of Monette's words in <em>Love Alone</em> was spread 
            when composers set them to music. Ned Rorem set "Here." At Monette's 
            suggestion, UCLA's Roger Bourland set the conclusion of the prose 
            introduction to the volume, the stirring passage ending: "All there 
            is is love." <br>
            <br>
            These words and music in combination were made more moving by their 
            performance through a new cultural institution, gay men's choruses 
            active in several American cities. Rorem's setting was performed at 
            Tanglewood and in New York, where reviewers noted that Rorem's setting 
            "renders Paul Monette's poem . with eloquence and directness." Bourland's 
            work received praise when premiered by Los Angeles's chorus. For one 
            listener "it opened a sense of hope." <br>
            <br>
            Rorem wrote Monette that he was "very very moved while working" to 
            set the poem, although "[a]s a Quaker and pacifist I'm a little disconcerted 
            by the image of lovers as warriors," the image given in the introduction 
            to the elegies. That idea of warriors fighting together-lines included 
            in Bourland's setting-would be central to Monette's next work, <em>Borrowed 
            Time: An AIDS Memoir</em>. </font></font> <br>
