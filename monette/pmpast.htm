            first novel, <em>Taking Care of Mrs Carroll</em> (1978), was written 
            while he was still living on the east coast, but its setting was inspired 
            by visiting Laguna Beach, south of Los Angeles, a longtime bohemian 
            and gay getaway. The zany novel does something new in gay literature. 
            It assumes the characters have come out. It is an exploration of how 
            gay men might create their lives together and with others, including 
            in this instance an aging lesbian movie star, Madeleine Cosquer, based 
            on Marlene Dietrich. Toward the end of the novel, the protagonist 
            notes what critic David Román has termed the epiphany of the novel: 
            "I gave up the past I wanted to invent all along with the one I spent 
            my life burying." This was a lesson that Monette himself was learning 
            as he and Horwitz made the decision to move from Boston to Los Angeles.<br>
            <br>
              The manuscripts of the novel seem to have been lost when Horwitz 
              and Monette moved. Only the last page of the holograph draft was 
              transferred in the papers at UCLA. On this only extant leaf, the 
              working out of the conclusion of the novel is apparent. The final 
              paragraphs are in the center of the page. After the protagonist 
              states he has been changed by the events of the novel, he questions 
              Madeleine about her long life and experience as an actress. Her 
              answer is rousing and ends the novel with one word gay men are so 
              often parodied for using: "'Fabulous,' she said. <br><br>
              <em>Taking Care of Mrs. Carroll</em> was published in 1978, the 
              annus mirabilis of emerging gay literature. Edmund White published 
              his third novel, <em>Nocturnes for the King of Naples</em>, with 
              an openly homoerotic dust jacket, Larry Kramer published his satire, 
              <em>Faggots</em>, and Andrew Holleran his elegiac novel, <em>Dancer 
              from the Dance</em>, the gay disco age's anthem, as works of F. 
              Scott Fitzgerald had been for the Jazz Age.<br><br>
              <em>Mrs. Carroll</em> was published when he was living in Los Angeles 
              and received good press but has been lost in the history of these 
              novels published by east coast writers. He hoped it would have an 
              impact because of what he thought was for then an unusual point 
              of view: "I take it absolutely for granted that gay people can make 
              joyful, coherent lives."<br><br>
            If Monette had been slow to come out of the closet, he had been making 
            various influential friends during those years that the gay community 
            and gay and lesbian literature and politics were also coming out of 
            the closet. Friends such as Craig Rowland, writing for community gay 
            and lesbian newspapers, reviewed his work. Monette was on the cover 
            of Boston's <em>Gay Community News</em> in 1978. The first national 
            gay news magazine was <em>The Advocate</em>, established in Los Angeles 
            in 1967. Its reviewer, Richard Hall, was the most prominent for gay 
            books at that time, and he wrote a rave review. The novel was also 
            reviewed by Jim Kepner, perhaps the first "gay journalist," having 
            worked on <em>ONE </em>magazine in Los Angeles since the early 1950s. 
            Published elsewhere were <em>After Dark</em>, the arts and entertainment 
            "gay" journal (it never touted itself as such, remaining in the closet 
            itself), and <em>Blueboy</em>, the "gay male lifestyle" and erotica 
            journal. Monette's novels benefited from these publishing firsts. 
            Excerpts of both <em>Mrs. Carroll</em> and <em>The Gold Diggers</em> 
            appeared in <em>Blueboy</em> with illustrations by George Stavrinos, 
            and an <em>After Dark</em> article asked, was Monette "Proust on the 
            Pacific?"<br>
            <br>
			  The novel also received 
              good reviews in mainstream journals, but Monette faulted the staid 
              Little Brown which had published his poems: "First novels don't 
              get much promotion and most publishers don't know how to promote 
              a gay novel anyway." The dust jacket photograph was taken by Horwitz, 
              making the novel a felicitous collaboration. The cover is a striking 
              graphic but not particularly gay in its appeal. The 1979 paperback 
              reprint by Avon was over the top gay for its day, showing two men 
              kissing in an uncredited drawing which seems to be by Stravrinos.<br><br>
              Even as Monette gave interviews to publicize <em>Mrs. Carroll</em>, 
              he was moving further away from poetry: "I became frustrated . with 
              this myth of myself that my poetry created. I was good at it and 
              did good work. But the older I got the more my being Gay was central 
              to who I was, and I had to find a way to let that be what my writing 
              was too. As I began to come out, I started a series of poems. They 
              were long dramatic monologues. .One was an encounter on a transcontinental 
              train between Noël Coward and Marlene Dietrich." His attendance 
              as a student at the gay playwright's play had been one impetus for 
              these poems.
			  <br><br>
              The manuscripts for the books' individual poems are visually fascinating, 
              written with much revision in inks of different colors. A whimsical 
              note from Horwitz about copying "Musical Comedy" for Monette gives 
              a glimpse of their domestic life. The poems use Monette's refined 
              camp sensibility even in their choice of an epigraph from Coward's 
              <em>Private Lives</em>:<dir><p align="left">Elyot: That orchestra seems to have a remarkably 
              small repertoire.<br>Amanda: Strange how potent cheap music is.</p>
            </dir>He continued to write poetry, with "My Shirts," a poem to Horwitz, 
            published in <em>Christopher Street</em> in 1977. That New York-produced 
            publication was the most influential gay literary journal at that 
            time. A poem to Monette's brother and sister-in-law in <em>Poetry</em> 
            earned him a letter from poet Louis Untermeyer, the noted anthologist 
            of the mid-twentieth century: "What an extraordinary poem it is-a 
            remarkable combination of the whimsical, the sotto voce macabre, and 
            the delicately but distinctly moving." The poems were collected and 
            published in 1981 by Avon as <em>No Witnesses</em> with drawings by 
            David Schorr. </font></font> <br>
