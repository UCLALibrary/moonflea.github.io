            Landry Monette was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, October 16, 1945. 
            This makes him (just barely) a baby boomer, born after the conclusion 
            of World War II. Had he lived, he would have been sixty years old 
            this year. His father, Paul Louis Monette (b.1923) was of French-Canadian 
            descent from Methuen, Massachusetts. After service in the war as a 
            navigator with flights over Japan, he first drove a truck for a coal 
            company. He rose to an office job, and the family moved to Andover. 
            His mother was Jacqueline (née Morin) Monette (1923-1990). He had 
            one younger sibling, Robert Lamb Monette, born November 6, 1951.<br>
            <br>
            His parents are shown here in handsome studio portraits. His grandmother, 
            "Nana" Lamb, and his brother are shown in a snapshot posed with the 
            boys' dog, Skipper. Monette and his father are shown in a small boat 
            on a lake in an idyllic eastern setting.<br>
            <br>
            Paul Monette did well in school, receiving nothing but praise on his 
            report cards. One is said to have noted: "Paul is perfect." One on 
            display here records, among his straight A's, that he was "a gentleman 
            at all times." He earned a scholarship to Phillips Academy, Andover, 
            as a "town" student, graduating 1963, and earned a scholarship to 
            Yale University, majoring in English literature, graduating 1967. 
            He was involved in numerous societies at Yale, and newspaper clippings 
            show his achievements: Yale Dean's List Students, Monette Wins Yale 
            Poetry Honor, Teaching Fellowship at Yale, Yale Graduate Will Study 
            at Oxford. He was the entrepreneur of various literary and arts events 
            and for an arts festival received a letter of commendation from Lady 
            Bird Johnson in 1966.<br>
            <br>
            The summer of his junior year he spent in England and other parts 
            of western Europe, ostensibly to study the works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. 
            His letters home are exuberant in describing new places and adventures 
            and brash when talking about his writing: "I sat on the beach all 
            morning . & finished the first chapter of the novel I will never finish." 
            In London, he saw Noël Coward in his "A Song at Twilight," one play 
            in which the gay playwright treated a gay subject openly.<br>
            <br>
            Monette did write his senior paper in English about Tennyson's "In 
            Memoriam," a sonnet sequence to his deceased friend, Arthur Henry 
            Hallam. The paper was supervised by noted critic and professor Harold 
            Bloom and contained statements which were prescient to the concerns 
            of Monette's later life and poetry: "The speaker still feels a sense 
            of injustice that Hallam was taken. The conflict between grief and 
            the old impulse to move on has not been resolved.." This would be 
            exactly Monette's situation as a writer years later. <br>
            <br>
            Monette's last college years and graduation came at the height of 
            the U.S. draft for Vietnam, which Monette addressed in a 1968 essay 
            for the Yale Alumni Magazine. In letters home from Europe, he had 
            written that he was asked about Vietnam but didn't know much about 
            it. In the article he quotes the French writer, Bernard Fall, at that 
            time about the most reliable source for an understanding of what had 
            happened since the French left the country. Monette concludes that 
            his "personal course of action is finally vague and selfish" as he 
            weighs alternatives&#8212;as did others&#8212;of going to Officer Candidate 
            School or prison.<br>
            <br>
            After graduation, he taught English in private schools, Cheshire Academy, 
            Milton Academy, and Pine Manor College. In the 1970 Cheshire yearbook 
            he is shown gesticulating expansively as he teaches about the contemporary 
            novelist John Updike. He published a farewell poem to his students: 
            <dir>
            <p align="left"> The long song stops<br>
              . . . . <br>
              filled with the far places<br>
              we went to<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and 
              the coins<br>
              we leave behind,<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	
              whenever<br>
              we say goodbye<br>
            </p>
            </dir>While teaching at Milton, he lived in the Boston area and continued 
            writing and publishing poetry, at one time living near Henry David 
            Thoreau's Walden Pond, making pilgrimages there to meditate and write.
