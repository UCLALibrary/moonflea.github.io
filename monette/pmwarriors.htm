            Monette has recorded that he didn't want to write non-fiction, but 
            his experiences with Roger Horwitz's dying of AIDS impelled him to 
            do so. At the same time that he was creating a new poetic style for 
            himself, he also crafted a compelling and rushing prose style. It 
            captured the venom against the establishment that was displayed in 
            the poetry, as well as the immediacy of his love for Horwitz. He began 
            this prose style with the introduction to <em>Love Alone</em> and 
            almost immediately began <em>Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir</em> (1988), 
            a love story, a story of Los Angeles, and a polemic against the forces 
            preventing full recognition of the AIDS epidemic.<br>
            <br>
            Monette made holograph notes for <em>Borrowed Time</em>, but they 
            are in a larger and more bold hand than he had used up until then. 
            He also typed an outline and proposal for the memoir and seemed to 
            proceed quickly and determinedly in this book whose famous first sentence 
            is: "I may not live to finish this."<br>
            <br>
            From the beginning of his preface to <em>Love Alone</em> he aligned 
            himself with the usually thought to be gay British World 
            War I infantry lieutenant Wilfred Owen. His poems of "the pity of 
            war" revolutionized the sensibility of war poetry. Monette wished 
            to change the presentation of gay men combating AIDS. The central 
            image given in the introduction to <em>Love Alone</em> was two men 
            as warriors together, the lines set to music by Roger Bourland, and 
            Monette develops this further in this story of Horwitz's dying.<br>
            <br>
            Monette continued in the memoir the warrior image which had disturbed 
            composer Ned Rorem. This trope derives from Achilles and Patroclus 
            fighting and loving together at Troy. Their love story is seldom preserved 
            in adaptations of the story, but it is alluded to in the visual presentation 
            of <em>Borrowed Time</em>. The dust jacket is a photograph of a statue 
            of Menelaus removing the dead body of Patroclus from the field of 
            battle. This cover image is larger on the advance proof copy shown 
            here than on the dust jacket of the published work. Even readers who 
            wouldn't know the full import of these warriors' story would sense 
            the support of one male for another in death. <br>
            <br>
            Monette was well aware of Susan Sontag's landmark 1977 work, <em>Illness 
            as Metaphor</em>, and her critique of the use of battle imagery when 
            discussing disease, for example, "fighting cancer," or speaking of 
            a disease which "invades" the body. His use of battle imagery was 
            not just to suggest an attitude toward the disease itself, pace Sontag, 
            but directed at the establishment arraigned against gay men and others 
            with AIDS. Society branded gay men as weak, as "twilight men" unable 
            even to care for themselves. Religion denied gay men dignity when 
            John Cardinal Ratzinger authored the idea that homosexual sex was 
            "an intrinsic evil." U.S President Ronald Reagan didn't mention the 
            disease, thus denying through politics a full confrontation of the 
            disease's horrors and ravages. <br>
            <br>
            <em>Borrowed Time</em> is also as much a paean to Los Angeles as were 
            his comedic novels. Interspersed with the harrowing details of disease 
            and death are descriptions of Los Angeles as a beautiful and consoling 
            place:<dir> 
            <p align="left"> Evenings at the brink of summer are yellow gold across 
              the city's western<br>
              face, as the sun narrows toward the ocean, eye to eye with the white<br>
              buildings of the coastal basin. The setting sun is especially prized 
              in late<br>
              May and June. Summer is something else again, sunny all day long, 
              till the<br>
              light expires of heat and boredom after Labor Day.</p>
            </dir><em>Borrowed Time</em> also praises UCLA and its doctors and 
            particularly its hospital nurses who cared for Horwitz.<br>
            <br>
            Monette's message was received with relief from readers of all kinds, 
            since the book is primarily a book about love and caring and grieving. 
            It doesn't offer the superficial messages of those like Louise Hay, 
            whom Monette and Kolovakos disliked, but renders a brutal and almost 
            day by day account of Horwitz's and Monette's suffering through Horwitz's 
            illness and death and mourning for him.<br>
            <br>
            Even more than <em>Love Alone</em>, the memoir <em>Borrowed Time</em> 
            received unprecedented fan mail. A representative stack of such letters 
            is here on exhibit. The letters come from those suffering from the 
            disease, from gay men themselves mourning the loss of lovers, from 
            family members or friends mourning such a loss, and from men and women 
            mourning a loss from other devastating illnesses. The book touched 
            a nerve and continues to touch such nerves with each rereading. Although 
            it didn't win the awards that Monette's next work earned, it will 
            remain a classic of American literature. It was probably because of 
            <em>Borrowed Time</em> and its insistent and needed public message 
            at the time that alerted readers and critics and reviewers and prize 
            givers to Monette's next non-fiction work, <em>Becoming a Man: Half 
            a Life Story</em>.<br>
            <br>
            Monette was also preparing himself more and more as a public speaker 
            and as an interviewee on the topics of AIDS and discrimination and 
            homophobia. He has stated that he didn't want to become the AIDS poster 
            boy, but he was well suited to this task and even spoke on such shows 
            as "Geraldo." In the Los Angeles area he appeared for a benefit at 
            Highways (Santa Monica), known as a performance space. He read from 
            his poetry from <em>Love Alone</em> and from <em>Borrowed Time</em> 
            he read what was advertised as his "new political writings." </font></font>
