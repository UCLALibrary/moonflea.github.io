a distinct and independent genre only a little more than two centuries ago.
Prior to the mid-eighteenth century books were rarely created specifically
for children, and children's reading was generally confined to literature
intended for their education and moral edification rather than for their
amusement. Religious works (see cat. nos. 7, 8, 14), grammar books, and
&quot;courtesy books&quot; (which offered instruction on proper behavior)
were virtually the only early books directed at children. In these books
illustration played a relatively minor role, usually consisting of small
woodcut vignettes or engraved frontispieces created by anonymous illustrators.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor356882"></A>Still, some exceptional works were published
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, which served as precedents for
later genres of children's literature. An early example of a book devoted
to children's games is the 1657 <I>Les jeux et plaisirs de l'enfance</I>
(The games and pleasures of childhood; fig. 4; cat. no. 4). Produced for
and dedicated to children, it is notable not only for its subject but also
for its numerous engravings after artist Jacques Stella. Still, the unnatural
attitudes of the children's bodies are indicative of the contemporary conception
of children as miniature adults.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor26462">1</A></FONT></B></P>

<P>Another important precursor was John Amos Comenius's <I>Orbis Sensualium
Pictus</I> (The visible world in pictures, 1658). An encyclopedic assemblage
of captioned illustrations of the natural world, it is regarded as the first
picture book for children. Comenius was an educational reformer, and his
book was also innovative in its recognition that there are fundamental differences
between children and adults. A forerunner of the illustrated schoolbook,
it remained popular in Europe for two centuries and was published in numerous
languages and editions (see fig. 1; cat. nos. 5, 6, 11, 13).</P>

<P>Alphabet books exemplify one of the earliest uses of pictures in instructional
books for children (see fig. 2; cat. nos. 33&#150;77). From the sixteenth
until well into the eighteenth century children learned their alphabets
by studying <B>hornbooks</B> (see cat. nos. 33, 38, 39, 50), wooden paddles
with inscribed alphabets that were often combined with religious writings
such as the Lord's Prayer. Out of the hornbook tradition developed the more
pictorial <B>battledore</B> (see cat. nos. 41, 45, 47, 54, 56, 58, 59),
a folded piece of cardboard with an illustrated alphabet, named after a
traditional game in which hornbooks were used as paddles. The battledore
endured until the mid-nineteenth century. By the early nineteenth century
other types of games with illustrations were developed for teaching ABCs
as well as math, grammar, and science (see fig. 3).</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor359180"></A>One of the most enduring genres of fiction,
fables (see cat. nos. 15&#150;32) were initially read in Latin in the classroom
rather than for amusement at home. The stories attributed to Aesop (supposedly
a Greek storyteller of the sixth century B.C. but almost certainly a legendary
figure) were among the most frequently published and illustrated (see figs.
5, 6). <I>Aesop's Fables</I> was published in its first English translation
by William Caxton (c. 1422&#150;91) in 1484. It soon became one of the most
popular illustrated books for children, though in many early editions there
was little attempt to adapt the stories to make them easier for children
to understand and relate to.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor29521">2</A></FONT></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="images/capn.jpg" WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="54" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><A NAME="anchor361146"></A>ew attitudes toward children and their education
began to develop in the late seventeenth century, when many educators appealed
for greater consideration of children's distinctive needs and when the notion
of pleasure in learning was becoming more widely accepted.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#anchor31754">3</A></FONT></B> Most indicative of this evolution of
ideas are the writings of philosophers John Locke (1632&#150;1704) and Jean-Jacques
Rousseau (1712&#150;78). In 1693 Locke wrote in <I>Some Thoughts Concerning
Education</I> that &quot;children <A NAME="anchor364773"></A>should be treated
as rational creatures. . . . They must not be hindered from being children,
nor from playing and doing as children, but from doing ill.&quot;<B><FONT
 SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor34011">4</A></FONT></B> Rousseau regarded childhood
as a pure and natural state&#151;one distinct from adulthood&#151;and believed that
a central goal of education should be to preserve the child's original nature.
He also believed that it was essential for teachers to see things as children
do.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor35970">5</A></FONT></B> The writings
of Locke and Rousseau influenced British educators, and their ideas ultimately
led to a more humane approach to education in which enjoyment was considered
an aid to learning.</P>

<P>By the early eighteenth century interest in children's literature (and
a rise in literacy) led to new markets and a flourishing of new publishers,
particularly in England. Innovations in typography and printing allowed
greater freedom in reproducing art through engraving, woodcut, etching,
and aquatint, although illustrators were still largely anonymous and illustrations
confined to frontispieces.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor369591"></A>Thomas Boreman was one of the first entrepreneurs
to respond to the market with his miniature books entitled <I>Gigantick
Histories</I> (1740&#150;43; see cat. no. 79) as well as other illustrated
books on subjects such as natural history (see fig. 9). The most important
of the early publishers was John Newbery (1713&#150;67). Newbery ran his
London bookshop from 1745 to 1767, publishing vast quantities of children's
literature of all types as well as a wide range of books on reading, philosophy,
and science, most covered in flowered and gilt Dutch paper and enlivened
by simple woodcut illustrations (see cat. nos. 82, 105, 131).<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#anchor38606">6</A></FONT></B> His first children's book was <I>A
Little Pretty Pocket Book</I> (1744), and one of the most popular was his
1765 <I>History of Little Goody Two Shoes</I> (see fig. 10; cat. nos. 82,
105, 131), regarded as the first novel written specifically for children
(it is said to have been written for Newbery by Oliver Goldsmith).<B><FONT

<P>Other enterprising London publishers who succeeded Newbery were John
Harris and John Marshall. In 1807 Harris published the innovative <I>Butterfly's
Ball and the Grasshopper's Feast</I> by William Roscoe (cat. no. 108), a
nonsensical rhymed tale of insects in the woods, which offered pure fantasy
unadulterated by moral lessons. Harris continued to publish more standard
didactic works as well as fairy tales and nursery rhymes. Marshall's books
were published in a variety of forms, including the first <B>infant's libraries,</B>
boxed miniature libraries (see cat. nos. 92&#150;94; ill. p. 6), as well
as <B>infant's cabinets</B>, decorated boxes containing small books and
pictures (see cat. nos. 96&#150;98, 100). Children's literature at this time
ranged from these more expensive editions to the widely published <B>chapbooks,</B>
inexpensive pamphlets distributed by peddlers throughout the countryside.</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor372917"></A>The two most significant genres of eighteenth-century
children's literature were the fairy tale and the moral tale. Fairy tales,
which had been passed down from generation to generation through oral tradition,
were first collected and put into print at the French court of Louis XIV
by writers such as the Countess d'Aulnoy, Madame de Villeneuve, and Madame
Le Prince de Beaumont. Charles Perrault's 1697 <I>Histoires ou contes du
temps pass&eacute;</I> (Tales of long ago; see cat. nos. 144, 146&#150;48,
150, 192) contain the first written versions of &quot;Cinderella,&quot;
&quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; &quot;Red Riding Hood,&quot; &quot;Blue Beard,&quot;
&quot;Hop o' My Thumb,&quot; and &quot;Puss in Boots.&quot;<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#anchor44110">8</A></FONT></B> Perrault's versions of these stories
have dominated English and American children's literature since the eighteenth
century. The frontispiece of his original edition (fig. 11) pictured an
old woman telling stories to a group of children, with the inscription <I>Contes
de ma m&egrave;re l'oye </I>(&quot;Tales of mother goose,&quot; a French
folk expression roughly equivalent to &quot;old wives' tales&quot;). This
was the first appearance of the character who would later be associated
with nursery rhymes when the Newbery firm attached the name to a collection
published under the title <I>Mother Goose's Melody; or, Sonnets for the
Cradle</I> (1781; cat. no. 154).</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="anchor375227"></A>Fairy tales, as well as popular adventure
tales such as Daniel Defoe's <I>Robinson Crusoe</I> (1719; cat. nos. 115,
121), often engendered criticism in the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries. Sarah Trimmer (1741&#150;1810), a noted author of moral lesson
books, denounced &quot;imaginary beings for children&quot; in her 1773 review
of <I>Mother Bunch's Fairy Tales</I>.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor46707">9</A></FONT></B>
Indeed, though numerous chapbook editions of Perrault were published throughout
the eighteenth century, they were generally overshadowed by more didactic
books that dealt with issues of morality or religion. It was not until well
into the nineteenth century that fairy tales came to dominate the children's
book market.</P>

<P>Moral or cautionary tales, in which good children were rewarded and bad
children were appropriately punished, were generally of less interest with
regard to illustrations than were fairy tales. Many were religious tracts
written under the influence of Anglican Evangelicals, and they were published
in great number throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,
by firms such as Newbery and Marshall. The proliferation of editions of
such books as Isaac Watts's Divine Songs (1715; see cat. no. 213) testifies
to the enduring popularity of works that put religious lessons into a more
enjoyable form. Among the most notable women authors of devotional literature
or moral tales in England were Trimmer, Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743&#150;1825),
and Mary Martha Sherwood (1775&#150;1851).</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor377057"></A>Movable parts appeared in scientific books
as early as the sixteenth century (see cat. nos. 1&#150;3, 10), but not until
the mid-eighteenth century were movable books conceived as entertainment
for children or adults. The toy trade also became increasingly important
as the children's market grew.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor48496">10</A></FONT></B>
The <B>harlequinade</B>, a type of novelty book named after theatrical pantomimes
featuring the harlequin in a leading role, was invented around 1765 by London
bookseller Robert Sayer (see cat. nos. 216&#150;18, 227, 228). Composed of
a single sheet of paper with illustrations on flaps that open to reveal
another picture below, the harlequinade immediately became immensely popular.
Also related to the theater were <B>juvenile drama sheets</B> (see fig.
16; cat. nos. 247, 248, 257, 258, 260), printed sheets of scenery and characters
out of which children created their own miniature theaters, the earliest
of which date to about 1810.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor50924">11</A></FONT></B>
Around the same time the London firm of S. and J. Fuller invented the paper
doll (see fig. 17; cat. nos. 156, 231, 233, 236, 243). These loosely inserted
cutout figures with removable heads were accompanied by stories in verse,
the most famous of which was <I>Little Fanny</I> (1810; cat. no. 231). Fuller
was also among the earliest publishers of <B>peep shows</B> (see cat. nos.
222, 224, 225, 242, 250, 251), books that open to form a hinged tunnel for
viewing, which were inspired by traveling peep shows. Other firms soon joined
the scenic book trade, the most notable of which were Dean and Son and the
German publishers Raphael Tuck and Ernest Nister. Nister's most important
contribution was the <B>dissolving picture book</B> (see cat. nos. 266,
271), in which the sheets were cut horizontally or into a circle so that
a new scene could be revealed by pulling a tab.</P>

<P>Games were common amusements for children in nineteenth-century England,
including board games (see fig. 18), card games, and puzzles. Of particular
interest were geographical games, a great many of which were produced by
members of the Wallis family, leading publishers of children's games from
1775 through the 1830s (see cat. nos. 219, 229, 234, 239, 244, 249). Maps
also provided images for puzzles, the earliest of which date to the 1760s

<P>Lothar Meggendorfer (1847&#150;1925) illustrated, designed, and engineered
the most elaborate and intricate movable books of the century, primarily
during the 1880s and 1890s. Though he was also a popular magazine illustrator,
his reputation today is based on his mechanical picture books for children,
and he is considered the creator of the modern movable toy book. Beginning
in the late 1880s and through the 1890s, his books enjoyed great popularity
and were published in a variety of editions and languages. He produced books
with movable figures operated by interconnected cardboard pieces sandwiched
between sheets of paper, transformation pictures with interchangeable segmented
parts, books with pop-up designs, and large unfolding books such as his
1899 <I>Das Puppenhaus</I> (The dollhouse; cat. no. 298). The technical
wizardry of these books remains unequaled (see figs. 15, 19; cat. nos. 281&#150;300).</P>

<P>World War I brought an end to the publication of movable books and their
importation to England from Germany, and the lack of fine printing facilities
in England and the United States led to a decline in the movable book trade.
The emergence of the pop-up book came after the war, however, and this simplified
version of its nineteenth-century predecessor has endured throughout this
century.</P>

of the idea of childhood as a period distinct from adulthood<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#anchor55452">12</A></FONT></B> and as a time to be enjoyed, at least
by prosperous middle-class Victorians. During the latter half of the century
many of the classics of children's literature in English appeared, including
Lewis Carroll's <I>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</I> (1865), Louisa May
Alcott's <I>Little Women</I> (1868&#150;69), Robert Louis Stevenson's <I>Treasure
Island</I> (1883), Mark Twain's <I>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</I> (1884),
and Rudyard Kipling's <I>Jungle Book</I> (1894). This period also saw the
emergence of the picture book, in which the illustrations&#151;and the artist's
vision&#151;were at least as important as the text. No longer anonymous, artists
were aided by technical advances in printing and a growing middle-class
market for books.</P>

<P>Late in the eighteenth century illustrations by Thomas Bewick (1753&#150;1828;
see cat. no. 22) and William Blake (1757&#150;1827; see cat. no. 109) began
to appear in British children's books, laying the foundation for the practice
of commissioning well-known artists to illustrate texts. Still, such high-quality
illustrations remained the exception rather than the rule. Until the mid-nineteenth
century most books were printed in black-and-white, primarily in the medium
of wood engraving, with the only color provided by the laborious and expensive
process of hand-coloring. After mid-century color printing was prevalent
in children's books, though many artists preferred the more reliable methods
of black-and-white printing until the 1870s (see fig. 22; see cat. nos.
315, 331).</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor382438"></A>English caricaturist George Cruikshank (1792&#150;1878)
made some of the most influential illustrations of the century when he created
etchings for the 1823 <I>German Popular Stories</I> (see fig. 23, cat. no.
302), the first English translation of the celebrated collection of folk
tales published in German several years earlier by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm.
William Thackeray declared Cruikshank's illustrations to be &quot;the first
real, kindly, agreeable and infinitely amusing and charming illustrations
in a child's book in England.&quot;<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor57606">13</A></FONT></B>
Cruikshank continued to influence the genre of children's books with his
illustrations for Charles Dickens's novels as well as his retellings of
favorite tales to emphasize his temperance beliefs, published in the 1850s
(see cat. nos. 167&#150;69, 174).</P>

<P><A NAME="anchor384050"></A>In the second half of the nineteenth century
technical and artistic innovations led to the emergence of children's book
illustration as a major artistic genre. Richard Doyle (1824&#150;83), who
contributed illustrations and political caricatures to the British comic
journal <I>Punch</I> in the 1840s and 1850s, later became famous for his
pictures of elves and fairies in such elaborate works as William Allingham's
<I>In Fairyland</I> (1870; see figs. 20, 21; cat. nos. 317, 345).<B><FONT
 SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor59724">14</A></FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor385379"></A>The greatest advances in color printing came
with the wood engravings of Edmund Evans and his development of the <B>toy
book</B> in the mid-1860s. These thin picture books consisting of eight
pages, each printed on only one side, between stiff paper covers, had existed
since the beginning of the Victorian era and were published in great numbers
by Dean and Son, Routledge, and other firms, but usually without the participation
of notable illustrators. Evans succeeded in engaging such major artists
as Randolph Caldecott (1846&#150;86), Walter Crane (1845&#150;1915), and Kate
Greenaway (1846&#150;1901), engraving and printing the books himself and
working with publishers for distribution.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="#anchor61693">15</A></FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="anchor386995"></A>Each of these artists brought a different
style to the Evans books. Crane was influenced by William Morris and the
Arts and Crafts movement as well as by Japanese prints. He illustrated a
variety of toy books for Evans, including alphabet books (see fig. 2; cat.
no. 321), fairy tales (see fig. 24; cat. nos. 322, 324), and nursery rhymes
(see cat. no. 323), most published by Routledge before 1876.<B><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#anchor63807">16</A></FONT></B> Caldecott took inspiration from English
caricaturists Cruikshank, William Hogarth, and Thomas Rowlandson, and the
stories he illustrated consisted primarily of traditional English tales
and nursery rhymes (see cat. nos. 339&#150;41, 350, 351). Greenaway&#151;who
gained extraordinary popularity with the publication of her first children's
book, <I>Under the Window</I> (see fig. 25; cat. no. 330), in 1878&#151;remained
adored by the public as well as by influential critic John Ruskin. Often
acting as both author and illustrator, she is best known for her idealized
illustrations of children in characteristic bonnets and quaint costumes
in picturesque settings recalling the English countryside (see cat. no.
338, 342, 343, 346). Books illustrated by these artists were also tremendously
popular in the United States, whose own publishing industry had not achieved
the high technical standards reflected in English picture books of the period.
Evans dominated the industry until his death in 1905, when commercial wood
engraving was replaced by photographic reproduction processes.</P>

(see fig. 26) and its sequel, <I>Through the Looking Glass</I> (1872; cat.
no. 370). <I>Alice</I> was one of the landmarks of the nineteenth-century
fantasy genre, helping to initiate a tradition of fantastical tales with
no obvious moral. Working in close collaboration with author Lewis Carroll,
Tenniel created illustrations that set the standard for a work that has
been interpreted by more than one hundred illustrators since its initial
publication (see fig. 27; cat. nos. 369&#150;81).</P>

<P>In 1880 Carlo Lorenzini (1826&#150;90), under the pseudonym Collodi, wrote
<I>The Adventures of Pinocchio</I> (see fig. 28; cat. nos. 382&#150;91),
which was first published in English in 1892. Collodi's story originally
appeared as a serial in the Italian magazine <I>Giornale dei bambini</I>
and is one of the most inventive and complex of nineteenth-century fantasies.
Late in the century in France Louis-Maurice Boutet de Monvel (1851&#150;1913)
further refined the art of the picture book with the elaborate color lithographs
for the 1896 <I>Jeanne d'Arc</I> (Joan of Arc; cat. no. 364). Some of the

advances that have made it possible to produce relatively inexpensive high-quality
illustrated books have contributed to tremendous growth in children's publishing.
Innovations in book printing in the early years of the century, particularly
in the use of photography and four-color processing, led to the development
of the deluxe gift book, which expanded upon the rich tradition of Edmund
Evans. Elaborate watercolors by Edmund Dulac (1882&#150;1953), Kay Nielsen
(1886&#150;1957), and Arthur Rackham (1867&#150;1939) in England, and the
paintings of Maxfield Parrish (1870&#150;1966) and N. C. Wyeth (1882&#150;1945)
in the United States, became the hallmarks of these books, with illustrations
printed on special glossy paper and tipped into the pages. The works of
Rackham, Dulac, and Nielsen varied in style and inspiration. Rackham emphasized
line, using pen and ink with watercolor to create evocative illustrations
for fairy tales and other stories (see fig. 29; cat. nos. 404&#150;7, 428,
429). Dulac's and Nielsen's work was noted for its colorism and influences
drawn from Eastern artistic sources such as Persian miniatures. A notable
example of Nielsen's intricate and exotic style is a suite of watercolor
illustrations for a never-published version of <I>One Thousand and One Nights</I>
(see fig. 30; cat. nos. 410, 412&#150;27). <A NAME="anchor388933"></A>Public
demand for deluxe picture books diminished after World War I. While interest
in Rackham's books persisted, younger artists such as Nielsen, who published
only four books of fairy tales, never achieved such sustained renown.<B><FONT

<P>Also dating to the early part of the century, books by Beatrix Potter
differed in style from the deluxe gift books, and her small, cozy books&#151;designed
so that even very young children could comfortably hold them&#151;instead follow
the picture book tradition of Caldecott. Her <I>Tale of Peter Rabbit</I>
was first privately published by the author in 1901 (cat. no. 398), with
a colored frontispiece and other illustrations in black-and-white, but was
soon followed by numerous editions with full-color plates (see cat. no.
400).</P>

<P>In the United States early twentieth-century color printing technology
made the simple black-and-white illustrations favored by Pyle and his contemporaries
seem outmoded. W. W. Denslow's illustrations for L. Frank Baum's <I>Wonderful
Wizard of Oz</I> (1900; cat. no. 396) included one hundred two-color images
and twenty-four full-color plates, making it one of the most elaborate books
of its time. Many illustrators continued to explore the possibilities of
black-and-white, however. For example, Wanda G&aacute;g's creative integration
of line illustration and text in <I>Millions of Cats</I> (1928; cat. no.
433) made her the first important American author-illustrator.</P>

<P>The earliest picture books by Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,
date from the 1930s and also reflect the importance of the author-illustrator
in twentieth-century children's books. Geisel was a former magazine cartoonist,
and his preliminary drawings reveal a complex process of merging text and
illustration to create his witty and lively &quot;logical nonsense&quot;
(see cat. nos. 444&#150;78). Lucille and Holling C. Holling's books of the
1940s evince a nostalgia for preindustrialized America, with rich illustrations
and texts focusing on the country's natural resources and on Native Americans'
interactions with the environment (see figs. 31, 32; cat. nos. 479&#150;87).</P>
