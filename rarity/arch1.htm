<p> Holdings document the exploration of new materials, the indoor-outdoor lifestyle 
    afforded by southern California's climate, and the connection of architecture 
    with the growth of the region. The papers of <b>A. Quincy Jones, Richard Neutra, 
    and Lloyd Wright</b> contain near-complete records of their work. The <b>Max and 
    Rita Lawrence papers</b> document architectural pottery and other items associated 
    with modern Los Angeles architecture, and drawings and photographs of <b>S. Charles 
    Lee</b> the evolution of motion picture theater buildings. Papers of landscape 
    architects include those of <b>Ralph D. Cornell, Edward Huntsman-Trout, Florence 
    Yoch, and Philip Chandler</b>, and there are records of the <b>American Institute 
    of Landscape Architects</b>.

    <b>Germain Seed Co. Seeds and Plants</b> [catalog]. Los Angeles, 
    1908. In: A collection of nursery catalogs, 1938 - 1960. Collection 1207

  <p> The address given is: 326 - 330 S. Main Street, Los Angeles. Inside notes 
    give this as the 37th year of the company, 1871 - 1908. The cover of this 
    catalog uses the romantic California imagery often used for other promotional 
    purposes, adding to the almost imaginary California mythology of "Spanish" 
    missions, in this case Mission San Gabriel. It appears to be a colored photograph 
    - note the telephone pole in the "Spanish" background. Compare this lush image 
    with the 1882 photograph of the Mission on exhibit under Photography. The 
    missions in a roundabout way became the dominant influence in California architecture 
    of the 20th century, first as Mission Revival, then with influences in Spanish 
    Colonial Revival in the 1920s and influences even today as that style is reprised. 
    The nursery catalogs were collected by Mildred Mathias, UCLA professor of 
    botany. The catalogs show fashions in printing and graphic design as well 
    as in plantings. Mildred Mathias was interviewed by the UCLA Oral History 
    Program. </font></td></tr></table>

  <p> This plan is a prototype landscape plan for various small tract homes (later 
    versions of California "bungalows") developed by Trousdale. A note on a drawing 
    by Huntsman-Trout for movie director Thomas Ince's gardens (ca. 1923) says 
    "moonlight garden," although no details seem to be recorded anywhere. Gardens 
    designed to be viewed by strong moonlight were originated by the Moguls. This 
    seems to be a version of such gardens, the plan calling for a bed of white 
    petunias backed by cassia and topped with white oleander. The white would 
    be bright against the silver gray green leaves, with sulfur yellow added when 
    the cassia bloomed. </dir>

 <p> <b>  Julius Shulman.</b> Grace Miller house, Palm Springs CA. 1939. Designed 
    by Richard Neutra, 1937. Black and white photograph, scanned copy. In: Neutra, 
    Richard Joseph, 1892 - 1970. Papers, 1925 - 1970. Collection 1179. Box 80
<dir>
  <p> This house was yet another example of Neutra's fine site planning and landscape 
    design, as well as architectural design. The modern materials contrast with 
    and frame from within the desert and mountains surrounding. This is a less 
    common view by photographer Shulman than others often reproduced. It shows 
    the variety of desert plantings. Modern California architects pioneered the 
    use of new materials but also worked within a larger California framework. 
    This house stems from the idea of California bungalows, but is even smaller 
    than those of the decades preceding it. While the late 1920s and 1930s were 
    the peak of various historical revival architecture styles in southern California 
    and garden design and plantings to complement them, designers and landscape 
    architects began to use native California plants in less traditional plans. 
    Neutra's planting list for this house shows his familiarity with the desert, 
    as does that of Huntsman-Trout. These plants were frequently shown on postcards 
    and are still today. Huntsman-Trout's drawing (above) notes "desert planting: 
    cottonwood, ironwood, desert acacia, smoke tree, ocatill[o], palo verde ... 
    ." Neutra's planting list was much the same. Dione (Mrs. Richard) Neutra was 
    interviewed by the UCLA Oral History Program.  </dir>

<b>  Ralph D. Cornell.</b> <i>Conspicuous California Plants, with Notes on 
    their Garden Uses</i>. Illustrations by the author. Drawings by Elizabeth Lewis. 
    Pasadena, California: San Pasqual Press, 1938. SB 466 U7 C2c 
<dir>
  <p>Ralph Cornell was UCLA's first landscape architect working only for this 
    campus. His original plans maintained the idea of a California landscape rather 
    than bow to the revival architecture of the original buildings. His friend 
    Theodore Payne was among the first of the California nursery persons to propagate 
    native plants for gardens, as were Theodosia Burr Shepherd in Ventura and 
    Kate Sessions, who often worked with architect Irving Gill, in San Diego and 
    La Jolla. This book was published in Pasadena by Dorothy Bevis, who looked 
    to a local rancho as the source for her firm's name. The press also published 
    historian W.W. Robinson's <i>Ranchos Become Cities</i> (1939) and Lawrence Clark 
    Powell's <i>Robinson Jeffers: The Man and His Work</i> (1940), based on his dissertation 
    at the University of Dijon. Ralph Cornell was interviewed by the UCLA Oral 
    History Program.  </dir>
