<dir>
      <p> Posada worked for the publisher Vanegas Arroyo in Mexico City. Posada 
        developed the playful<i> calavera</i> ("skull") imagery associated with 
        the <i>Dias de los muertos</i> (Days of the Dead) for political and general 
        humorous uses. This particular image shows Vanegas Arroyo surrounded by 
        the minutiae of printing: boxes for type and with <i>calaveras</i> operating 
        the press. They are also shown with bottles of tequila and glasses, dice 
        and other games of chance, a pistol, and flower blossoms. Posada's imagery 
        influenced such artists as Diego Rivera in the 1920s and later Chicano 
        artists in the U.S. in the 1960s as they reclaimed their artistic heritage. </dir>

    <b> Sir Richard Francis Burton, 1821 - 1890. </b><i>The Sotadic Zone.</i> 
      New York: Privately printed by the Panurge Press, 1930? This edition is 
      limited to two thousand and ten copies, ten copies of which are for the 
      editors of the Panurge Press. Special Collections copy: No.597. Special 
      Collections SRLF 
<dir>
      <p> Printings of "The Sotadic Zone" are oddities produced from Burton's 
        translation of The One Thousand Nights and One Night. For the Benares 
        Edition of the 1001 Nights, he wrote a "Terminal Essay," then repressed, 
        but later often printed with this title. Another example in the Dept. 
        is entitled <i>Anthropological Notes on the Sotadic Zone of Sexual Inversion: 
        Including Some Observations on Social and Sexual Relations of the Mohammedan 
        Empire. </i>(New York: Privately issued by Falstaff Press, ca. 1930?). 
        This was not Burton's title at all, and he worked before there was a discipline 
        called anthropology. But in this comparative essay he proposed a theory 
        of same sex activity, supposedly more prevalent in areas of what he termed 
        the Sotadic Zone, comprising many places where Burton himself traveled 
        and lived. He defined these as primarily tropical, but areas such as Alaska 
        were included, all "non Western." It is possible that some of this is 
        to be taken tongue in cheek, although there is no certainty of it from 
        his tone. Many later writers would refer to his ideas and research, for 
        example, J. A. Symonds in <i>Problem in Greek Ethics</i>.
