  <p><b>Raymond Chandler, 1888 - 1959.</b> <i>Double Indemnity</i>. [Screenplay 
    by Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder, from the story by James M. Cain] Hollywood, 
    Sept. 25, 1943. 117 leaves. Typescript (mimeograph). Billy Wilder's copy with 
    notations throughout. In: Chandler, Raymond, 1888 - 1959. Papers, 1930 - 1959. 
    Collection 638 Box 14</p>
   <dir>
    <p> Director Billy Wilder has detailed notes on virtually every page of dialogue 
      and all facing blank pages of the mimeographed text. (Barbara Stanwyck is 
      to appear in slacks, white shirt, and black glasses.) Austrian &eacute;migr&eacute; 
      Wilder teamed with Raymond Chandler to delineate specific Los Angeles locales 
      as had never been done before in motion pictures. The characters meet on 
      a street lined with palm trees in a Spanish Colonial bungalow. At Jerry's 
      Market near the writers' employer's studio, the characters meet secretly 
      amid the abundant produce of the market to cover up a murder.

    1351. Box 11</p>
   <dir>
    <p> By the time of Chandler's and Wilder's screen play, the Spanish Colonial 
      style here depicted had become so ubiquitous that they would describe the 
      d&eacute;cor of their character's bungalow as "Spanish craperoo in style."</p></dir>

<p><b>Los Angeles Times photo.</b> Sal Mineo publicity shot. 1958. Scanned 
    copy of complete negative with original marks and labels printed approximately 
    8" x 10". Caption from the <i>Times</i> 1958 May 21: "CAUGHT SHORT - Sal Mineo, who 
    said he'd rather wear a barrel than have a fan accused of stealing, tells 
    Officer Bill Grell how he happened to lose most of his clothes to a giggling group 
    of teen-agers." In: Los Angeles Times. Photographic archives, ca. 1918 - .

  <dir>
    <p> This is but one of millions of negatives in the <i>Times</i> records, and of 
      tens of thousands of photographs relating to Hollywood publicity and history. 
      As is often the case, there is a series of negatives not published. One 
      shows the naked Mineo alone with the concealing barrel, so the idea of being 
      "arrested" seems to have evolved later.</p></dir></font>

     Carolyn See collected this work when writing her UCLA dissertation in 
      English under John Espey, professor of English. Gwen Davis became a best 
      selling author, but there are few copies of this work noted in other libraries. 
      See used this novel to discuss changing attitudes of sexuality depicted 
      in movies. One character seems based on actors like James Dean or associated 
      with him, like Sal Mineo. There is even an essay from one character on changing 
      masculinity in motion pictures, "Whatever Became of the Red-Blooded American 
      Male?" </p></dir>

 <b>Elmont Clovis.</b> <i>The Topless Bathing Suit: An Exhaustive Survey 
    in Words and Photographs.</i> Photographs by Paul Duckworth. New York: MacFadden-Bartell 
    Corp., [1965]. SCB 135691</p>
  
    <p>Los Angeles fashion designer Rudi Gernreich's ideas such as
unstructured garments helped create liberated women in the 1960s. His
topless bathing suit in 1964 changed the way women dressed in the 
latter half of the twentieth century. It garnered headlines, as
this "sensational" ripoff shows. The cover graphic is a discreet 
adaptation of a model wearing the topless suit, with copy asking, "Who 
wears it - and where? What does it look like?" In the early 1970s Gernreich's 
unisex fashions concepts were the first to blur gender distinctions as a major fashion statement. These changes in the cultural and sexual mores of the times are examples of many which began in Los Angeles.
<p>
Most of his clothing has been given to other institutions, but the
papers at UCLA are the most complete for his family history and the
history of his fashion and other businesses. The papers include a small
number of documents of gay history, including notes for early meetings
of the Mattachine Society in the 1950s. </p>

  <dir>
    <p> These are 1970s editions associated with motion pictures, yet another 
      collection the Dept. has made of a particular genre of popular literature. 
      These three are movies of actor Jan Michael Vincent, at the height of his 
      popularity during these years. The "red-blooded American male" seemed to 
      have returned. These novelizations are not held by many public institutions. 
      <i>Baby Blue Marine</i>, is, however, listed as held by the library of the Quantico 
      (Virginia) Marine Corps Base, where officers are trained.</p></dir>
