  <p>The foundation for printed Californiana is the second collection of bookseller 
    and librarian <b>Robert Ernest Cowan</b>. His <i>Bibliography of the History 
    of California, 1510 - 1930</i> (San Francisco: printed by John Henry Nash, 
    1933) listed 4,700 titles. UCLA's collection has more than 80 percent of these 
    titles, as well as many works he did not identify. Collection has continued 
    since the Cowan acquisition, with recent focus on works about and printed 
    in southern California. 
  <p>Non-book materials in a variety of formats derive mainly from 1840 onward 
    and include records and papers for many interconnected activities in the region's 
    development: agriculture, architecture and landscape architecture, the 
    book trade and fine printing, civic development, civil liberties, crime, dance, 
    education, fashion design, journalism, labor relations, literature, local 
    politics and reform, the motion picture and television industries, real estate 
    development, natural resources particularly water, and special events, such 
    as the 1932 and 1984 Olympic games. Many personal papers are supplemented 
    with UCLA Oral History Program interviews.</p></font></td></tr></table>

 <b>Deed from Mexican period of California.</b>
  Grantor: Manuel Dom&iacute;nguez; grantee: Narciso Botello. 1843 Feb 7. 1 folded leaf. 
  Holograph. Signed by Dom&iacute;nguez and Botello with their paraphs. In Spanish on 
  <i>papel sellado</i>. Note in English: "Recorded at request of Pio Pico ... 1876. ..." 
  In: Robinson, W. W. (William Wilcox), 1891 - . Papers, ca. 1843 - 1972.  Collection 
  2072. Box 83 f.9
  <p><dir> 
       
             Deeds of this period are 
            quite rare. Botello was secretary of the ayuntamiento (town council). 
            Dom&iacute;nguez later served as alcalde (mayor) of Los Angeles and as a 
            delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1849. The location of 
            the lot was probably just south of the present Plaza in the old pueblo. 
            In 1876 J. J. Warner (previous owner of Agua Caliente, better known 
            as Warner's ranch) added a statement that the signatures were genuine.

    One folded leaf. Scanned copy. In: Littlefield family. Correspondence, 1850

   <dir>
    <p> Lambert Littlefield and some members of his family came to California 
      from Maine in the 1850s. Letters and diaries from this period give vivid 
      pictures of the life of the times. They have long been favorites for small 
      press publications in California. Some letters recall the hardships of the 
      journey: "He could not go the wormey bread ... and the stinking meat." They 
      are also sprinkled with optimism: "I find California to be a good place 
      as I expected." There are glimpses of the women who made the overland journey, 
      as given at the bottom of the page shown: "I have seen several ladies that 
      came across the plains. I saw one as they were coming in driving an eight 
      ox team. She drove with a long lash and when she would crack it over their 
      heads they had to pick up their heels."</p></dir>

 <b>No compiler office given.</b> [Abstract of title to Rancho San Pasqual 
    properties]. 1873. 1 v. Bound in full red leather. In: Robinson, W. W. 
    (William Wilcox), 1891 - . Papers, ca. 1843 - 1972. Collection 2072. Box 73 
    f.1.</p>
  <dir> 
    <p> This volume is shown unopened, its bulk an example of the complicated 
      sets of land records needed to establish the ownership and transfer of ownership 
      of the land grants. Rancho San Pasqual was located near the Mission San 
      Gabriel. This volume and the deed above are from the collection of writer 
      and historian W. W. Robinson, whose specialty was creating California history 
      from its land documents. His <i>Ranchos Become Cities</i> was published by the 
      San Pasqual Press in 1939. He was the first president, Friends of the UCLA 
      Library.
<p> W. W. Robinson was interviewed by the UCLA Oral History Program.</p>

<b>Helen Hunt Jackson, 1830 - 1885</b>. <i>Ramona; A Story</i>. Boston: 
    Roberts Brothers, c1884. PS 2107 R14 1884. <br>Another edition, Boston: Little, 
    Brown, 1916. Introduction by A. C. Vroman. SCB 151555 </p>
  <dir> 
    <p>This book was written to publicize the plight of California's Mission Indians. 
      Mrs. Jackson lived only a year after its publication. Although it is a work 
      of fiction, Carey McWilliams blames most myth making of California history 
      and culture on this work. It would be Mrs. Jackson's - and Ramona's - fantasy 
      which held sway as California began to construct a history to present to 
      the rest of the county and the world.<p> Carey McWilliams was interviewed by

 <b>Home of Ramona, South Veranda </b>[color postcard of Rancho Camulos]. 
    Los Angeles, M. Rieder, ca. 1910? No. 521. In: Collection of California postcards, 
    1890 - . Collection 1351. Box 15</p>
  <dir> 
    <p> In architecture, Ramona was perhaps the first to advocate indoor outdoor 
      living. The first paragraph describes a rancho adobe and states: "[Ramona] 
      could not quite fancy life without a veranda." Finding the supposedly real 
      sites and characters of the novel became a craze around the turn of the 
      century. Rancho Camulos in Ventura Co. was one such site. Photographer A. 
      C. Vroman published his photographs of the sites in various editions. This 
      postcard seems to have used one of his photographs. It is used as a basis 
      for the graphic on the pictorial cloth cover of the second version of the 
      book displayed, which includes his other photographs of the supposed sites 
      of the novel.</p>

<b>Bertha Haffner - Ginger, b. 1868.</b> <i>California Mexican - Spanish 
    Cookbook: Selected Mexican and Spanish Recipes.</i> Los Angeles, Citizen Print 
    Shop, c1914.</p>
  <dir> 
    <p> The color pictorial cloth boards of this volume show elements from California's 
      geography and history, including desert scenes and a "California mission." 
      It is probably the California Building designed by the New York trained 
      San Francisco architect A. Page Brown for the Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 
      1893 - in other words, a building which never existed in California, but 
      whose design helped to establish California's Mission Revival architecture. 
      It is possible that Bernard Maybeck contributed to the design. It was thought 
      that a combination of "Mission and Moorish" could be adapted to modern use 
      and yet represent the historic landmarks of the state.
<p>The cookbook's title 
      maintains the separation of "Spanish" and "Mexican" which would prevail 
      long into the 20th century.</p>

 <b>1945 Rosedale's Nurseries [catalog].</b> [Los Angeles, 1945]. In: 
    A collection of nursery catalogs, 1938 - 1960. Collection 1207
 <p><center>
 
 <img src="rosedales4.jpg"></center>
  
 
   
    <p><dir> This collection was made by Mildred Mathias, UCLA professor of botany. 
      The catalogs are an indicator of the plants used widely to create the look 
      of the California urban and suburban landscapes and the imagery of various 
      periods of its history. This shows a Moderne building (one of the nurseries) 
      pointing to the post WW II future, cars are parked ready to pick up 
      an abundance of plants for a do-it-yourself garden, and all of this is in 
      a landscape lush and brilliant. </dir>

    <p> The banners and printed ephemera of the 1984 Olympics set the tone throughout the city for one of
