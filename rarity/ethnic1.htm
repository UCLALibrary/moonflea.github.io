Most collections for <b>African Americans</b> are 20th Century and include the papers 
    of <b>Ralph Bunche</b>, the <b>George P. Johnson Negro Film Collection</b> comprising printed, 
    photographic and manuscript materials; the <b>Civil Rights Movement in the United 
    States Collection</b>; and the records of the <b>Golden State Mutual Insurance Company</b>. 
    Printed materials include the <b>Arthur B. Spingarn Collection of Literary Works 
    by American Blacks</b> and pamphlets on the <b>Civil War and Reconstruction</b>.
<p> Documentation 
    for <b>Japanese Americans</b> is the largest for any single ethnic group and is considered 
    the foremost in the country. It is mostly contained in the <b>Japanese American 
    Research Project</b> and focused on the Issei. It includes more than 100 groups 
    of personal papers of individuals and families; several thousand responses 
    to surveys conducted in the 1960s of the Issei, Nisei, and Sansei generations; 
    over 400 tape recorded <b>oral histories</b>; art done by internees during World 
    War II; rare publications of Japanese American communities and organizations; 
    records relating to Japanese consulates on the west coast; and the administrative 
    records of the project.
<p> The department has some material for the study of 
    all periods of <b>Chicano/a history</b>, particularly in relation to California. 
    At present, the major strength of the holdings relates to documentation on 
    issues of immigration, labor and social justice from the 1920s through the 
    1940s and includes papers of <b>Carey McWilliams</b> and <b>Alice McGrath</b>, and the latter's 
    records as secretary of the <b>Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee</b>. Sources available 
    for the study of the Mexican heritage include <b>Nahuatl documents</b> and <b>19th and 
    early 20th Century prints</b>.
<p> There are growing holdings relating to <b>Chinese 
    Americans</b>, <b>Filipino Americans</b>, <b>Korean Americans</b>, and <b>Native Americans</b>.</p>

<p><b>Photographer unknown</b>. The Sleepy Lagoon defendants (Manuel Delgado, Henry 
    Leyvas, John Matuz "Chepe" Rivera ...) in San Quentin Prison. 1943. Black 
    and white photograph scanned and enlarged from copy negative. Signed by each 
    defendant and inscribed "To Alice with love from her boys." In: McGrath, Alice 
    Greenfield, 1917 - . Papers, 1943 - 1990. Collection 1490. Box. 2 f.12 (original 
    unavailable pending conservation) 

   
    <p>Alice Greenfield (later McGrath) was in her twenties when she worked with 
      Carey McWilliams and many other concerned citizens during this time of prejudice 
      against Mexican Americans to overturn the decision against young men tried 
      for the murder of Jos&eacute; D&iacute;az. Twenty-two (one Anglo American) were tried 
      as one. Five were acquitted. The seventeen were convicted with various sentences 
      despite the fact that no evidence placed them near D&iacute;az. The appeal was 
      made by Ben Margolis from groundwork laid by George Shibley during the trial. 
      October 4, 1944 McGrath was able to wire Leyvas in San Quentin: "Decision 
      reversed. Victory. Will wire further details when we have them. Oh, what 
      a beautiful morning [punctuation supplied]." Alice Greenfield McGrath was 
      interviewed by the UCLA Oral History Program. Ben Margolis was interviewed 
      by the UCLA Oral History Program. </p>

<b>[Samples of clippings / index cards about African American entertainers, 
    writers, etc. From alphabet A - C]</b> In: Johnson, George P., 1885 - 1977. Negro 
    film collection 1916 - 1977. Collection 1042. Various boxes [use microfilm]</p>
  <dir> 
    <p> There are thousands of these cards and clippings kept in alphabetical 
      order by Mr. Johnson. Entries are typed or clippings are pasted on to index 
      cards, but as often on envelopes or other paper cut to that size. They are 
      now microfilmed for preservation and use. Since many (not all) are from 
      obscure and unindexed sources, this is an invaluable resource for the study 
      of African Americans in film, and to some extent in other performing arts 
      areas. Johnson's brother Noble Johnson was among the first African Americans 
      to produce motion pictures. George P. Johnson was interviewed by the UCLA 
      Oral History Program.</p>

    <p> One of George P. Johnson's clippings notes this controversial best selling 
      novel of the 1960s was to be made into a movie, which has never been done. 
      Arthur Spingarn was one of the first white men to work with civil rights 
      legislation and served as president of the NAACP for 26 years. His collection 
      was purchased in 1966. It has since been added to.</p>

<i><b> Our World 1943 - 1944 Manzanar High.</b></i> [Yearbook of students interned 
    at Manzanar Relocation Center]. Manzanar, 1944. On cover: Our World, Manzanar, 
    California. In: Adams, Ansel, 1902 - . Papers, 1938 - 1944. Collection 696. 
    Box 1</p>
  
    <p><dir> Our World seems to be a typical high school yearbook. It is for Japanese 
      American students interned with their families at Manzanar. Some of the 
      photographs usual in such a publication - of the drama group, for example 
      - were taken by Ansel Adams. The yearbook is dedicated to "those people 
      with ... simple pleasures ... those men and women with their green growing 
      gardens of the spring." The cover reproduces a map of the area, with its 
      names visible: Independence, Lone Pine, Owens Lake, Panamint ... . </dir></p>

    <p>Christine Sterling made Olvera Street a commercial strip about 1934 by 
      stressing its romantic heritage. This view is framed by cactus and palms 
      and shows men with sombreros with City Hall in the background. A prejudice 
      remained. Nearby land of the old Chinatown was condemned to build Union 
      Station 1934 - 1939.</p>
