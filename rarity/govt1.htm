<p>The department has broad holdings relating to government and politics at 
    both the national and local level for California generally and Los Angeles 
    locally.
<p> Papers of <b>General William Starke Rosecrans</b> and of <b>U.S. Senator Cornelius 
    Cole</b> are major resources for the 19th Century. The books, pamphlets, and ephemera 
    of the <b>John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation</b> and the papers of <b>Dr. 
    Haynes</b> and <b>Franklin Hichborn</b> document early 20th century California and Los 
    Angeles reform politics, complemented by papers of <b>Edward A. Dickson</b> and <b>Katherine 
    Philips Edson</b>. The <b>Clifford E. Clinton</b> papers and the <b>Joseph Shaw</b> papers document, 
    from different perspectives, reforms of the 1930s and 1940s. Papers of a number 
    of local congressmen carry the record forward: <b>Anthony Beilenson</b>, <b>Augustus 
    F. Hawkins</b>, <b>Carlos Moorhead</b> and <b>Edward Roybal</b>. Records of the <b>California Democratic 
    Council</b> and the <b>California Republican Assembly</b> provide material for the study 
    of the important grass roots politics of California from the 1930s on.
<p> The 
    <b>Mayor Thomas Bradley Administrative Papers (1963 - 1993)</b> record the administrative 
    activities of Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley, whose tenure in office covered 
    a record five terms.</p>

  <p><b> Katherine Philips Edson.</b> <i>The Actual Operation of Woman's Suffrage 
    in California;</i> by Mrs. Charles Farwell Edson. Los Angeles, 1912? 1 folded 
    leaf. "This paper was read at one of the sessions of the convention of the 
    National Municipal League held in Los Angeles, Cal., July, 1912." In: Edson, 
    Katherine Philips, 1870 - 1933. Papers, 1909 - 1934. Box 6 f.2</p>
  <dir>
    <p> Katherine Edson began working with the Friday Morning Club and was appointed 
      to state office by Governor Hiram Johnson. Although Mrs. Edson worked very 
      much within the two party establishment, she suffered as much discrimination 
      at times as Alice McGrath and Dorothy Healey, who did not.</p>

<b>Views of Clifton's: Pay What You Wish, Dine Free Unless Delighted</b> 
    [cover title]. [Los Angeles: Clifton's Cafeterias, 1951?]. In: Clinton, Clifford 
    E., 1900 - 1969. Papers, 1934 - 1969. Collection 2018. Box 10 f.3.  Also other Clifton's ephemera from about the same period.</p>
  <dir>
     
<p> Views of the cafeterias, both in downtown Los Angeles: "Pacific Seas" on Olive Street, 
      now demolished, and Brookdale, on Broadway. Views include the "Redwood trees" 
      of Brookdale and at Pacific Seas, the "DINING ROOM through one of the neon trees" 
      and "RAIN-HUT ... where it rains every twenty minutes."
<p> Crime and reform 
      politics entered the unlikely arena of cafeterias when restauranteur Clifford 
      E. Clinton served on the Grand Jury investigating vice in Los Angeles. He 
      then worked for the recall of Mayor Frank Shaw and the election of Fletcher 
      Bowron, who would be mayor 1938 - 1953, serving longer than any one until 
      Mayor Tom Bradley. But before the reform was accomplished, the car of an 
      investigator Clinton hired was blown up. This was reported in "They Bombed 
      the Lid off Los Angeles" and a series in <i>Liberty Magazine</i>, "My Husband's 
      War with the Vice Czars of Los Angeles." </p>
