Known as Nahmanides, Moses ben Nahman 
    was born in Spain and died in the Holy Land. One of the great minds of Jewish 
    scholarship during the Middle Ages, he was the author of over 30 works. This 
    volume, a commentary on the Pentateuch, is considered his masterpiece. The 
    first edition was printed in Rome about 1480. This second edition is perhaps 
    the first book printed in Portugal; it is certainly the first book printed 
    in Lisbon. It is well preserved and almost complete, which is unusual for 
    a Hebrew incunable. The Hebrew script is very beautiful. The text of the title 
    page is enclosed within woodcut borders and several leaves begin with woodcut 
    initials. This is the oldest printed book in the UCLA Library's Jewish Studies 
    collection.</font></td></tr></table>

<b>Harris Newmark, 1834 - 1916.</b><i> Sixty Years in Southern California, 
    1853 - 1913:</i> Containing the Reminiscences of Harris Newmark. Edited by Maurice 
    H. and Marco R. Newmark. 4th ed., rev. and augmented with an introduction 
    and notes by W. W. Robinson. Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, 1984. <p><dir>The reminiscences 
    of this Los Angeles Jewish businessman have given invaluable details of history 
    of the city. The book was first published in 1916 in New York. The Dept. has 
    copies of that edition. Later editions were done by Los Angeles booksellers 
    Jake Zeitlin & Josephine Ver Brugge (1970) and by the Dawsons, all of whom 
    are themselves business and cultural institutions of the city.

<p> The introduction 
    to this volume is by local historian W. W. Robinson, also a Los Angeles institution, 
    whose papers were given to the Dept. Robinson wrote: "Harris Newmark, a young 
    German Jew fresh out of East Prussia, arrived in Los Angeles in 1853. He came 
    to love the town, so much so that in his final, affluent years he and his 
    family produced this book of reminiscences as an expression of a pioneer's 
    gratitude for the opportunities of life a free America had made possible."</dir>
