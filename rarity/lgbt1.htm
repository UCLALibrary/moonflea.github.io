<p> The department holds LGBT Studies materials in all collecting areas described 
    in the department guide and in this exhibit, from incunabula to lesbian pulp 
    fiction; from the first "gay study" in English (1883) to paperback popular 
    psychology. In addition to printed materials there are personal papers and 
    oral histories.
  <p> The material enhances the Department's holdings of importance in the social 
    and cultural history of Los Angeles, to include interrelated materials of 
    persons from ethnic, racial, and other minorities. 
<p>Collections from LGBT persons 
    place their actions and creativity with other Los Angeles history and indicate 
    how LGBT persons themselves created the context for other events and social 
    change, particularly during the early years of liberation.

  <b>John Addington Symonds, 1840 - 1893.</b> <i>A Problem in Greek Ethics. </i>
    [London?] 1883. With the author's revisions and deletions made in preparation 
    for publication as an appendix to Havelock Ellis's <i>Sexual Inversion</i>, 1897. 
    It was suppressed. Ten copies printed privately for the author's use. [no.5]. 
    Autograph of H. Ellis on fly leaf. With Symonds's note: This essay was written 
    at Clifton Hill House about 1874, printed by Ballantyne & Hanson at Edinburgh 
    in 1883. Special Collections SRLF
<p><dir> In this work, the first "gay study" in English, 
    Symonds refers to German writers before him (late 1700s), writers who also 
    looked to ancient Greece for an apologia of homosexuality (a word recently coined 
    and not then in usage). He also refers to more recent writers, such as 
    Sir Richard Burton. The Symonds heirs suppressed publication of this revision 
    in Ellis's work. The work is rich in allusions to Greek literature, quoting, 
    for example, Maximus Tyrius: "He dares to court his friend in daylight and 
    rejoices in his love. He wrestles with him in the playground, and runs with 
    him in the race, goes afield with him to the hunt, and in battle fights for 
    glory at his side." At the bottom of the right hand page shown is Symonds's 
    note referring to the work of Sir Richard F. Burton.

    1840 - 1893.</b> <i>Studies in Sexual Inversion Embodying A Study in Greek Ethics 
    and A Study in Modern Ethics</i>. [New York]: The Medical Press of New York, 1964. 
    On cover: The Classic Study of Homosexuality in Ancient and Modern Times. 
    To be added
<p>
<dir><i> A Problem in Modern Ethics</i> was first printed posthumously in 1901. 
    This combination of both works was evidently first printed privately in London 
    in 1928. Out of copyright reprints of works like Sir Richard Francis Burton's 
    "Terminal Essay" and Symonds's essays were done for erotic interest as much 
    as education in the 1960s when censorship began to be relaxed. At the same 
    time circulating these 19th century works perpetuated outmoded attitudes and 
    terminology - "sexual inversion" - in the very decade of liberation. Although, 
    as seen above, Symonds was to have published with Havelock Ellis, this work 
    has nothing to do with Ellis's influential work with the same title.</dir>

<p>"Body building" magazines 
    began about 1908 with <i>Physical Culture</i>, a publication of Bernarr Macfadden. 
    There were others, but by the 1940s and 1950s they were still masking themselves 
    with titles such as <i>Adonis, Apollo, Grecian Guild Pictorial</i>. This issue even 
    carries an article on Greek sculpture, copying texts such as those of Victorians 
    J. A. Symonds and Walter Pater, who had written about Greek art and wrestling 
    - Pater about 1894 in his essay "The Age of Athletic Prizemen: A Chapter in 
    Greek Art." The na&iuml;ve text in this magazine relates: "The Grecian love of 
    physical perfection was the natural companion to their perfection in art. 
    It expressed itself in physical culture and athletic contests ... to them 
    the male physique at its best was among the most sublime forms of beauty."

    stone in the ruins covered in Greek characters ...." He alludes to the fragments 
    of meaning for lesbian women: "We have the poems of Sappho because the one

    McPharlin. Mount Vernon, NY: Peter Pauper Press, 1948? Special Collections 
    SRLF
<p><dir> UCLA Library has long collected this press, with an exhibit of their 
    earlier work in 1945. This is one of several editions published by the press 
    from 1942 on. One edition is as late as 1966. Sappho's poems have been translated 
    for all, but her name and birthplace Lesbos became the derivation for names 
    and codes for women loving women: Sapphics (particularly in Paris at the beginning 
    of the twentieth century) or Lesbians.</dir>

    Through Lesbos's Lonely Groves</i>. SCB 137311
<p><dir>This writer later wrote juvenile 
    books under the name M. E. Kerr, but published lesbian works under the name 
    Ann Aldrich. This is an example from the middle period of lesbian pulp writing, 
    primarily fiction (although this is not a fictional work). Writings on homosexuality 
    and lesbianism of this time were presented sensationally, with code words 
    such as "alone" or "Lesbos" to indicate their content and with covers often 
    in conflict with the meaning of the author's story, meant to attract male 
    readers. Authors wrote under the disapproving influence of the psychiatric 
    establishment of the times. Most theories did not discuss lesbians, but Helene 
    Deutsch in the 1920s - 1940s developed negative concepts of lesbians, who 
    in relation to their mothers had "an excess of infantile regressive elements 
    or hate components." </dir>

    homosexuality, 1968 - 1981. Collection 2083 Box 7
<p><dir> The authors reclaim Sappho 
    as a positive influence relatively early in the feminist movement and in the 
    theories of lesbianism emerging after gay liberation, generally dated as after 
    the Stonewall Riots, 1969. The authors state it is "the first serious nonfiction 
    account of the Lesbian experience, described carefully and logically from 
    an authentic inside perspective rather than the prejudging eyes of an orthodox 
    psychiatric disapproval." 
<p>This cover shows a liberated lesbian whose depiction 
    is not designed to attract male readers, as had been the case before.</dir>

<b>[Lesbian and Gay community buttons]</b> In: Kight, Morris. Papers, 1975 - 1993. 
    Collection 354. Items to be added
<p><dir>This selection of buttons also gives positive 
    views of lesbian and gay lives, in that the slogans and catch words are presented 
    by and for lesbians and gays, often in satirical opposition to prevailing 
    negative phrases.
<p> Imagery and colors are primarily from the 1980s and 1990s 
    using lavender and shades of pink and purple as positive symbols for the community, 
    whereas in the past such usage might be derogatory, such as the phrase "lavender 
    men." Other similarly derogatory terms, like "dyke," are reclaimed for slogans 
    such as "Dyke - O - Rama." These slogans are variations on coming out of the 
    closet or political send offs of the military such as "The Few, The Proud, 
    The Gay." One button is a more serious quote from African American lesbian 
    poet Audr&eacute; Lorde: "Your silence will not save you."
<p>Activist and collector 
    Morris Kight has spent much of his life in the causes of gay liberation. He 
    and others founded the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center in 1971, now the 
    largest of its kind in the world.
<p> Gay activist Harry Hay, who began his political 
    work before Kight, was the first openly gay person to be interviewed by the 
    UCLA Oral History Program.</dir>
