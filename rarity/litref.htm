<li>Chandler, Raymond, 1888 - 1959. Letter to Wilbur [Jordan] Smith. London, March 
    19, 1958. 1 leaf. Typescript, signed Raymond Chandler. 
<p>
<dir>Lawrence Clark Powell 
    and then Wilbur Smith wrote to Chandler about obtaining his manuscripts. Chandler 
    at first thought there were none of any interest. Smith persisted and eventually 
    all manuscripts were then sent to UCLA. In this letter Chandler maintains 
    his idea that his manuscripts are probably not of use to the Library or any 
    one else: "I can't possibly understand why it should be of any more interest 
    to you than my laundry list." He describes his method of typing "triple space, 
    on narrow sheets, ... in order not to become too prolix." He did send the manuscript, 
    but, alas, not the laundry list.</dir>

<P><dir>
	Roditi was asked why he gave his papers to UCLA in the 1950s. His answer supported Powell's long ago idea that it would be a source of pleasure to collect modern writers and literary papers in a young institution. Roditi had met Powell in 1945 when working on his book on Oscar Wilde. Roditi "felt that Yale, Harvard already had too much in the way of papers; they'd be lost in the amount that they have there. This [UCLA] was an expanding campus, an expanding library ... . And so I started donating here, and I don't regret it." He continued to give papers and publications, with  correspondence and various visits to campus and to the Dept., until his death in 1992. </dir><p>

<p><dir>Smith noted that Percival emphasized English books of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, an emphasis continued by UCLA. But even Smith, away from the University at this time, didn't write about the greater use of juveniles by feminist and women's studies scholars; however, Smith had been collecting books by women writers and thus building for these new studies his entire career in the Department.</dir><p>
