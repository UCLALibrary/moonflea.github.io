  <P>The department has holdings of printed and manuscript collections 
  supporting research in the history of printing, the graphic arts, 
  bibliography, the book trade, fictitious imprints (1600 - 1900), and emblem 
  books from the 16th through the 19th centuries. While every printed item in 
  the collections can be considered an artifact of some aspect of printing 
  history, below are highlights of active collecting areas.

The collection of the publications 
  of Aldo Manuzio, his family, and imitators was begun in 1961 during the tenure 
  of Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy. It has become the foremost Aldine collection 
  in North America. The UCLA collection contains more than 750 items listed in 
  A.A. Renouard's <I>Annales de l'imprimerie des Alde</I> (Paris: Jules 
  Renouard, 1834). The department has nearly 80 percent of the books printed by 
  the elder Aldo. 

 <p>
 
The Ahmanson-Murphy Collection of Early Italian Printing was established to expand 
  research holdings printed during the period of the Aldine collection. More 
  than 300 printers are represented. Items from the Franklin D. Murphy Early 
  Italian Printing collection are on display under <A 
  href="hebraica1.htm">Hebraica 
  &amp; Judaica</A>. 
  <P>Franklin D. Murphy was interviewed by the UCLA Oral History Program.

  <P><B>[Planudean] Greek Anthology</B>. <I>Florilegium diversorum epigrammatum 
  in septem libros...</I> . [Venetiis, 1503.] Edited by Aldo Manuzio; based on 
  the Florence editio princeps of 1494 with a few additions. Aldine device on 
  title page and verso of final leaf. From the estate of Templeton Crocker. Z 
  233 A4A62 
  <P>
  <DIR>Poems from the Greek Anthology have been popular for fine printing since 
  its beginning. This work, though not an incunable, is the first printing by 
  Aldo of poems from this work. The binding is a Venetian binding in the style 
  known as alla greca, ca. 1515 - 1535. The collection of incunables (books 
  printed before 1501), primarily by the printer Aldus Manutius and his heirs, 
  began with a purchase of a collection whose sale was brought to the attention 
  of Wilbur Smith in 1961, that of San Francisco collector Templeton Crocker. 45 
  books were purchased through funding obtained by then Chancellor Franklin D. 
  Murphy. He continued to foster these collections through his lifetime, and 
  they are now endowed through the Ahmanson Foundation. </DIR>

  <H4>Modern Fine Printing &amp; Graphic Arts</H4>The department has coordinated 
  its collections of modern fine presses, particularly those of California 
  printers, with the Clark Library. Special Collections is a repository of 
  publications of the Black Sparrow Press (California) and the Whittington Press 
  (England). The Department maintains a collection of graphic arts ephemera 
  (mostly prospectuses) begun by Jake Zeitlin.

  <DIR>This edition was printed by Saul Marks, often considered Los Angeles's 
  finest printer. A second edition was printed in 1970 by Ward Ritchie, another 
  great area printer and publisher, and a great friend of Powell. 
  <P>Robinson published dozens of works of local history but spoke of this work 
  as his finest stylistic achievement, a work which begins: "The Malibu is a 
  broad, twenty-two mile long strip of ocean-fronting land that lies midway 
  between Santa Monica and Ventura in Southern California. Entirely within Los 
  Angeles County, it is partly marine terrace, partly beach, partly canyon, 
  partly rising mountain."

        <P>This publication is a local one, done with local printing talent and 
        the Greek artist Achilleas (Achilles) Droungas. The work is still not 
        included in Williams's <I>Collected Stories</I>. Several colophon pages 
        were returned from Williams to the publishers with stains from spilled 
        wine. Williams biographer Donald Spoto has noted, in <I>The Kindness of 
        Strangers</I>, that "the odd crew [Williams] met that summer [1953, 
        traveling Europe and Tangier with Paul Bowles] inspired the weird 
        assortment" in this story.
