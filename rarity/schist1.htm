      <p><dir> Lawrence Clark Powell was hired by University Librarian John Goodwin 
        to work in Acquisitions in 1938. 
      <p> Powell was among the first librarians to theorize about rare books and 
        special collections. In this article Powell makes a virtue out of the 
        difficulties of collecting for a new institution such as UCLA: "Rather 
        than competing vainly with the rich university library in amassing collections 
        of ancient and expensive rarities, the college [or university] library 
        might well concentrate on the contemporary field. They would find it both 
        inexpensive and exciting."

        to be kept together, as well as items collected for the future. Under 
        the section "Rare Books" Powell notes: "Inclusion in one of the classes

      The Dept. was not housed separately until rooms were built in the west 
        wing of what is now the Powell Library Building in 1950. This invitation 
        notes that "for the first time the Library possesses adequate facilities 
        for the maintenance and public use of rare books, manuscripts, archives, 
        and related materials."

<p><b>University of California, Los Angeles. Library.</b><i> Rare Books and 
      Research. </i>Addresses given at the dedication of the Department of Special 
      Collections, July 28, 1950. Los Angeles, 1951. Designed by Ward Ritchie, 
      Los Angeles. Contents: Introduction by L. C. Powell.-Remarks on rare books, 
      by H. R. Wagner.-The collector of rare books, by G. L. Harding.-Rare books 
      and research in history, by J. W. Caughey.-Rare books in a university library, 
      by J. T. Babb.-The prevalence of riches, by Neal Harlow. University Archives. 
      Cataloged copy URL Z987 C129r 
      <dir><p> The use of two terms - rare books / special collections - for the Department 
        shows that there was no agreed upon term for such departments and that 
        they were still meant to appeal to book collectors. But the title of the 
        volume stresses research as the reason for such collecting alongside the 
        other needs of a public institution of higher learning and its faculty 
        and students. 
      <p> Speakers were chosen to represent these diverse views, with Wagner perhaps 
        the most distinguished collector of rare books in southern California 
        at that time. Ewing and Caughey were each then younger faculty working 
        with Powell to build the Library. Babb, librarian of Yale University, 
        represented the east coast establishment. Neal Harlow gave details of 
        collections recently donated and on display. Some of these collections were: the library 
        of former Provost Ernest Carroll Moore, papers of Provost Clarence Dykstra, 
        papers of Regent Edward A. Dickson, proofs given by Christopher Isherwood, 
        papers of Franz Werfel given by Alma Mahler Werfel.

      <dir><p> This project was begun by James V. Mink, later to head the Dept. 
      <p> The foreword gives a concise history by Powell and his concise statement 
        of purpose of the Dept.: "to conserve material and to serve scholars." 
      <p> This guide attempted a complete list of collections, which shortly after 
        this time became impossible. It was never again attempted. The Dept. has 
        reported collections to NUCMC and has only recently converted manuscript 
        records to MARC records, and in addition some manuscript collections finding 
        aids appear on the California Digital Library on line. But these do not 
        for the most part include the thousands of individual manuscripts and 
        prints and photographs not appearing in the finding aids as part of larger 
        collections.
