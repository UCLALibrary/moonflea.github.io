              became the Sleepy Lagoon case grew out of an atmosphere of wartime 
              anxiety and hysteria, much like the U.S. has experienced in the 
              wake of the September 11 attacks. It began in February 1942, following 
              the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, with the internment of 120,000 
              Japanese-Americans, two-thirds of whom were United States citizens. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif">On 
              August 2, 1942, a young Mexican national named Jos&eacute; Diaz 
              was found dead near a reservoir nicknamed the &#8220;Sleepy Lagoon.&#8221; 
              Local media outlets, most notably the Hearst-owned <em>Los Angeles 
              Evening Herald </em>and Express and the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, 
              blamed Diaz&#8217;s death on a &#8220;crime wave&#8221; led by Mexican 
              American &#8220;zoot-suiters&#8221; or &#8220;pachucas/os.&#8221; 
              More than six hundred youth, mostly Mexican Americans, were arrested, 
              many based on nothing more than their clothes or general appearance. 
              Thus, the existing atmosphere of wartime fear and suspicion took 
              on the added aspect of anti-Mexican racism. Renowned writer, lawyer, 
              and civil rights advocate Carey McWilliams identified the connection 
              between World War II, the Japanese-American internment, and this 
              anti-Mexican backlash: &#8220;In Los Angeles, where fantasy is a 
              way of life, it was a foregone conclusion that Mexicans would be 
              substituted as the major scapegoat group once the Japanese were 
              removed.&#8221; (<em>North from Mexico</em>, p. 227).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Twenty-two 
              youths were indicted in the Diaz case; seventeen were tried in a 
              mass trial, the largest in California history, and the remaining 
              five were tried individually. The trial began in October 1942 with 
              an all-white jury and only seven judges for the seventeen defendants. 
              Three defendants were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced 
              to life in prison, nine were convicted of second-degree murder and 
              sentenced to five years to life, and five were convicted of assault 
              and released for time served. The five who were tried individually 
              were acquitted. The twelve convicted of first- or second-degree 
              murder began serving their sentences in January 1943 at San Quentin 
              Prison.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif">During 
              the trial, labor activist La Rue McCormick had established an ad-hoc 
              committee to publicize the events surrounding the case. The mainstream 
              media&#8217;s coverage was predictably sensationalistic and inflammatory, 
              while the alternative media, including the left, labor, Jewish, 
              Mexican, and African American presses, covered the trial and ensuing 
              events from a perspective more favorable to the defendants. After 
              the defendants were sentenced, the committee was reorganized as 
              the Sleepy Lagoon Defense Committee (SLDC), with Carey McWilliams 
              as its chair. Support for the SLDC came primarily from organized 
              labor and political social justice advocates as well as from the 
              defendants&#8217; family members and prominent members of the film 
              industry.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Aided 
              by the SLDC&#8217;s fundraising efforts, a team headed by lead appellate 
              attorney Ben Margolis, Jr. launched an appeal in the Second District 
              Court of Appeal (66 Cal Ap 2nd 166) on the grounds of denial of 
              constitutional rights, misconduct by the judge, and insufficient 
              evidence. In October 1944, the appellate justices voted unanimously 
              to overturn the verdicts and set aside the sentences. The twelve 
              were released, having spent almost two years in jail and prison.</font>
