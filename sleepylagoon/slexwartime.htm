              n February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 
              9066, which called for the evacuation of any person thought to be 
              a threat to national security from the West Coast. In the Los Angeles 
              area, the FBI and police conducted searches of Japanese and Japanese-Americans&#8217; 
              homes and seized items such as radios and cameras thought to be 
              &#8220;suspect.&#8221; Persons &#8220;of Japanese ancestry&#8221; 
              were rounded up and transported to assembly centers and then to 
              internment camps. Local news headlines boasted &#8220;Roundup of 
              Japs&#8221; and posted photographs of Japanese citizens&#8217; property 
              being searched, confiscated and their families separated and evacuated. 
              Some Italian and German residents of the United States were also 
              interned, but those of Japanese descent were most feared, targeted 
              and restricted.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times"> 
              In this climate of fear, and with the Japanese removed, Mexican 
              citizens who had come to Los Angeles in great waves of immigration, 
              and Mexican-Americans, became the target of the press. By the time 
              José Diaz was found dead on August 2, 1942 near the &#8220;Sleepy 
              Lagoon,&#8221; there were already other types of roundups reported 
              in the local press-those of Mexican youth, coined &#8220;gangs,&#8221; 
              &#8220;young hoodlums,&#8221; &#8220;baby gangsters&#8221; and &#8220;pachucos.&#8221; 
              Headlines such as &#8220;Gangs Warned Kid Gloves Off&#8221; put 
              young Mexicans on notice that the police were about to &#8220;make 
              the streets safe for everyone&#8221;.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times"> 
              Carey McWilliams described these roundups of Mexican-American youth:</font></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times"> 
                If one spreads out the span of one&#8217;s right hand and puts 
                the palm down on the center of a map of Los Angeles County with 
                the thumb pointing north, at the tip of each finger will be found 
                a community where the population is predominantly Mexican. In 
                each of these neighborhoods, moreover, a majority of the juveniles 
                living in the area will be found to be first-generation Mexican-Americans, 
                sons and daughters of the Mexican immigrants who came to Southern 
                California during the 1920's.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times"> 
                . the police selected the neighborhoods which lay at our fingertips 
                on the maps and then blockaded the main streets running through 
                these neighborhoods. All cars containing Mexican occupants, entering 
                or leaving the neighborhoods, were stopped. The occupants were 
                then ordered to the sidewalks where they were searched. With the 
                occupants removed, other officers searched the cars for weapons 
                or other illicit goods.</font></p>

              Following the death of José Diaz, more than six hundred youth were 
              arrested. About two weeks later, Sheriff E. W. Biscailuz submitted 
              a cover letter headed, &#8220;Statistics&#8221; to the Grand Jury 
              in which he thanked them for their cooperation &#8220;in endeavoring 
              to find a solution to the present juvenile problem,&#8221; and asking 
              them to endorse the recommendations made in related reports by Clem 
              Peoples, Chief of the Criminal Division, statements of the Los Angeles 
              Police Department, and what came to be known as the &#8220;Ayres 
              Report.&#8221; Captain E. Duran Ayres, chief of the Foreign Relations 
              Bureau of the Los Angeles sheriff's office presented a special report 
              on &#8220;the Mexican problem&#8221; to a committee of the Grand 
              Jury. This report compared the character of &#8220;the Caucausian, 
              especially the Anglo-Saxon&#8221; to that of the &#8220;Indian or even 
              the Latin.&#8221; Referring to the &#8220;Mexican element,&#8221; it was stated, &#8220;.all 
              he knows and feels is a desire to use a knife or some lethal weapon. 
              In other words, his desire is to kill, or at least let blood. And, 
              &#8220;When there is added to this inborn characteristic that has come 
              down through the ages, the use of liquor, then we certainly have 
              crimes of violence.&#8221; This report then came to represent the view 
              of law enforcement in Los Angeles.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times"> 
              A subsequent open Grand Jury hearing (October 8, 1942) was arranged 
              by one of its members, Harry Braverman, to allow the Grand Jury 
              to consider statements made in opposition to the Ayres Report. Presenting 
              at this hearing were Carey McWilliams, Dr. Harry Hoijer of UCLA, 
              and others who represented various organizations such as the CIO 
              and the Mexican consulate, having the effect of influencing the 
              press to de-emphasize the word &#8220;Mexican,&#8221; but only for 
              a brief period.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Garamond, Palatino, Goudy Old Style, Times New Roman, Times"> 
              With twenty-two indicted in the Diaz case, seventeen were tried 
              en masse and five tried individually. On January 12, 1943, the verdicts 
              were announced: three were convicted of first-degree murder and 
              sentenced to life in prison, nine were convicted of second-degree 
              murder and sentenced to five years to life, and five were convicted 
              of assault and released for time served. The five who were tried 
              individually were acquitted. The twelve convicted of first- or second-degree 
              murder began serving their sentences in January 1943 at San Quentin 
              Prison. </font></p><br></td>
