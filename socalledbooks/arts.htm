<b>Artists’ Books in the Arts Library</b>

<p>
The Arts Library began collecting artists’ books in 1985, when it made the first of two large purchases of books from the collection of Judith A. Hoffberg. At that time the library’s staff had little experience with artists’ books and in fact discovered that they had previously acquired Edward Ruscha’s <i>Twentysix Gasoline Stations</i> and had cataloged it under "Petroleum industry and trade." After the Hoffberg acquisition the Arts Library started collecting in earnest, emphasizing works produced in multiple copies and priced under $50 that complement the holdings of the Charles E. Young Research Library Department of Special Collections.
<p>
Thanks to the generous support of donors such as Hoffberg and Robert Heinecken, both of whom have archival collections named in their honor, the collection has grown considerably. The Arts Library continues to select materials for its artists’ book collection in keeping with the spirit of the original selection guidelines, although the price limit has certainly increased. Particular attention is paid to artists’ books as agents of social change, the book as a conceptual space, and artists’ books that pay self-conscious attention to book structure. In addition to the regular program of purchasing new acquisitions, supporters continue to donate books that enrich the library’s collection.
<p>
<b>Artists’ Books in the<br> 
	Charles E. Young Research Library Department of Special Collections</b>
 
<p>

The Charles E. Young Research Library Department of Special Collections actively collects contemporary artists’ books and fine press printing. Many of these works relate to existing collecting areas, thus allowing the department to build on its strengths while expanding its holdings of contemporary book production. 
<p>
Books printed in Los Angeles as well as throughout California document printing, publishing, and cultural expression in the region and around the state. Works produced in formats or on subjects related to existing holdings are also acquired. For example, publications with a connection to the Children’s Book Collection may incorporate elements of alphabet books, fairy tales, and movable books. Other subjects for artists’ books related to departmental holdings include Californiana, ethnic studies, Hebraica and Judaica, literature, natural resources, photography, and the West.
<p>
In addition to works representing various subject matters, the department’s collection includes a wide range of physical formats and techniques, from the traditional book printed and bound by hand to works that explore and expand the concept of the printed codex as a vehicle for intellectual and aesthetic expression.
