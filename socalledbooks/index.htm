 <img SRC="indextext2.jpg" ALT="This traveling exhibition featuring the work of Southern California book artists has been on the road since 1999.  An earlier incarnation began at the San Francisco Center for the Book and traveled to the Center for the Book in New York and the Marriott Library at the University of Utah. It concludes its national tour here at UCLA, where its contents are complemented by selections from the Arts Library and the Charles E. Young Research Library Department of Special Collections, each of which has a rich collection of artists' books." NOSAVE>
